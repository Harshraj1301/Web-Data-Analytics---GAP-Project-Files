The best tacos I've had in the United States. Period.I had Pastor and Chorizo tacos. Four of them. I'm stuffed and I want four more. Damnit,5.0 star rating
"Suuuuuper nice people (they even threw in a free extra taco when they found out we were first timers!) and they're open LATE all the time, which is awesome.We got tripas (which my friend was pumped about bc he says it's hard to find) and pastor, and they threw in a barbacoa. Plus we got a yummy grapefruit soda.The only disappointment was the flour tortillas- not that great:/",4.0 star rating
"This place was the bomb (and no I was not drunk)... they have an actual trompo (top rotisserie) where the pork cooks and they cut the thin slices of meat. This is hard to find in south Austin, do yourself a favor and go try this place!",5.0 star rating

"Great tacos and terrific service. They had our order ready immediately and the woman who took it was extremely friendly and helpful. The pastor tacos were absolutely honest and delicious. I usually order flour tortillas wherever I go, but they have incredible corn tortillas here. I highly recommend checking this place out for traditional style tacos.",5.0 star rating
"No manches, guey. These are the best tacos I've had out of a truck in Texas, maybe the US. This is real Mexican food, and tastes just like it does in Guadalajara. And to top it off, the hours are amazing, the ambiance is good for a taco truck, and its *clean*! Amazing.",5.0 star rating

This place is great! The pastor tacos and burrito are delicious. Also the chicken fajita torts was awesome. Last but not least the club sandwich is so great I have to force myself to not order it. Great food and service!,5.0 star rating
"I stopped here for my first breakfast in Austin and I'm glad I did! Their breakfast tacos are to die for, along with their amazing salsa. The service has always been friendly and very efficient. I don't think we've ever waited long for our food. We ordered take out once as well, and that came out reasonably fast. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some great food at a good price in south Austin!",5.0 star rating
"I am tempted to not share how much I loved this place, but I guess that's not fair to the greater Yelping good. A friend recommended the breakfast tacos here, so I stopped by the nondescript location in a gas station strip mall parking lot and was blown away. SUCH flavorful bites in warm, amazing breakfast tacos. Poblano peppers, potatoes, eggs, chorizo...simmered in sauce and love. The servers were very friendly and helpful and the food came out fast.Sit there or call ahead and take to go. Limited parking in the lot (it fills up fast, people love this place).",4.0 star rating
"Their barbacoa and egg taco is one of the best tacos in town. The service is fast and friendly, and I just love this place.",5.0 star rating
"if you want fresh tacos and hearty quesadillas​ with the power to mend broken hearts, cure hangovers, and soothe any cravings of the stomach and soul, this is the place for you. the service was wonderful, the flavors were fresh, the portions were just goldilocks right and there's plenty of parking in this complex! the breakfast tacos were soft and warm and fresh and i added poblano peppers on, got the chicken quesadilla with a side of guac. highly recommend the tacos - we ate them faster than you can say guacamole.",4.0 star rating
"Wow, I was very impressed with this place.  When we decided to go out to breakfast with my daughter and her friend I couldn't figure out why she wanted to go someplace so far away when there are so many places closer. After we got our food I could certainly see why. It was absolutely delicious, reasonable prices, good portion, great service. It was really hard for me to not get Migas because that's my favorite breakfast whenever I come to Austin for a visit but I saw that they had Nopalitos on the menu so I couldn't resist and I wasn't sorry. It's pretty hard to make beans distinctively good but somehow this place does it. I just kept eating those beans until they were all gone. In fact I don't think I had any leftovers at all but my daughter gave me hers since she figured she was going to be too busy wrapping up the school year to have time for leftovers. I enjoyed them the next day. There are many good places to choose from in Austin but I hope I get back to this one another time while I am in town.",5.0 star rating
"Tacos were gross, horchata was gross. Save your money and do not come here! I just finished my meal purchased today June 21, 2017 and had to write a review because before coming here all I saw was 5-star reviews to a place that deserves 1 star. (Which is what brought me in) I ordered 2 pastor tacos ($3 each) and one horchata ($2.50) To start, the tacos were way too greasy and were on store bought flour tortillas. GROSS. The ONE salsa they had wasn't spicy, it was just bland. Eww. The horchata tasted like it had chemicals in it.. it had a very bad after-taste. I took two sips and had to throw it away. Honestly, just save yourself the $$.",1.0 star rating
"Best breakfast tacos, EVER!! Best local joint in the south Austin area to order ahead and swing by to pick up breakfast tacos.",5.0 star rating
"I usually have a good experience here. I don't recall names, but I like it here. Reasonable prices, good customer service, and good food. I am well aware of the hours, demand, busyness of the breakfast traffic, and cooking time. I've been trying to call in an order for more then 20 minutes. Sometimes the call is busy and sometimes it rings and rings and rings and rings. This happens quite a bit when I call in. I have great customer service when I go in and sit down. The to go orders is what gets me. I've seen it when it has been busy, i see that the employees work hard. They even answer the phone when they are checking someone out on the register. So I'm little discombobulated why this phone call thing is an issue.Taking in a to go order takes less then a minute.  I am okay with waiting for the food. I am frustrated that the phone hasn't been answered. Calling in an order is very convenient for me in the mornings. Again, I am usually very satisfied here. I'll be taking my business elsewhere this morning.",3.0 star rating
"good food for good prices, and they always play good music. Sometimes they give out free cake on holidays :) mmm que rico",5.0 star rating
"We live nearby so we are at this place every weekend, but I'd probably drive to get these tacos even if we weren't close. The service is casual and very friendly, coffee is decent, and the tacos are on point. My go-to is the beef fajita with nopalitos or the migas especiales. The potatoes and beans that come with the breakfast plates are great. When it's busy the tacos are very good, when it's slow the tacos are GREAT. The salsa has a nice kick and the food is never undersalted or bland. We always take visitors from out of town here because it has a great atmosphere and is very consistent. We don't bother with ""brunch"" places anymore when we can just go to San Juanita's. The younger guy that always waits on us is very sweet and often remembers our order. Even when we move, this place will always be a great memory for us. We have a large group of friends in the neighborhood and this is our version of Monk's from Seinfeld. Great spot!",5.0 star rating

The Brisket Tacos Are Really Good but The Only Thing I Dnt Like At All About This Place Is That They Charge You $7 Additional To What Your Bill Is If You Decide To Sit Down & Eat There Inside The Restaurant.,3.0 star rating
"Boom! Best Mexican breakfast in S. Austin. I love the Migas here. I get the Migas especial which includes traditional Migas with choice of meat, the chorizo or sausage are my favorites. It includes tortillas, potatoes that are perfectly seasoned and cooked and refried beans. The red salsa/ sauce is amazing and flavorful. Total price less than 8 bucks and you will be full until dinner. Friendly attentive staff. A great place to try if you haven't been. Plenty of parking in the rear if the front is full.",5.0 star rating
Great place to stop in for reasonably priced breakfast tacos (2 for around $4). The lady at the front was very nice and I got my tacos in minutes. The migas and bacon/egg were very good. Just wish the salsa was a bit spicier and that the tortillas were homemade. Can't wait to come back and try more tacos!,4.0 star rating
"I stopped by San Juanita's right before I hit the road to head back to Lubbock. I ordered the chorizo, egg, and cheese breakfast tacos with a large coffee. In order to use a debit/ credit card you must spend more than $5 and the tacos are $1.89+ tax. The restaurant is def a hole in the wall like others have mentioned, and it was pretty hot inside. I wouldn't recommend eating there. That being said, I chowed down in my car, hot sauce and all. The tacos were pretty good! Large portion with no skimping. Check them out if you have the time. Another taco joint to add to the long list of Austin bites.",3.0 star rating
"The ground beef looked and tasted like something over than beef. It had the texture of canned dog food. The staff was rude, and I will never go again.",1.0 star rating
"Went here for lunch because of the ratings and the fact that it was right down the street from the seminar I am at.  I have a rule about ethnic food.  If there is no one of that particular ethnicity at that restaurant.  I become suspicious.  I was the only white person in the restaurant when I went in.  This built my confidence.  The server was fast and friendly, which was good because I was on a bit of a time crunch.  The only reason I'm docking this restaurant at all is because the salsa was a little over puréed.  I'm not a fan of chunky salsa, but I also don't care for liquid.  Aside from that the flavor was good, and it had solid spice.I ordered the crispy chicken taco plate, because I figured it would come out fast.  I wasn't wrong.  The service was fast, the food was hot and the tacos were excellent.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Also the price for 3 tacos was more than reasonable.  I left a big tip, and now a good review.  This place is worth a visit.",4.0 star rating
"This place is great. It's very simple, straightforward Mexican. My husband and I ordered the migas, queso, and lemonade. The migas were really good. Very authentic migas, i.e. not drowning in sauce and queso. The queso was the yellow kind. Very tasty, but super liquidy. The lemonade was awesome. They make it fresh, and it had the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Great service too.",4.0 star rating
"This place is upsetting... I ordered 2 bean and cheese tacos with napales and my total came out to 6.80! Talk about jacked up prices... They then tried to charge me a dollar for cilantro and onions... Bringing the total up even more... I was mind blown since these tacos aren't even that great... The tortilla was soggy, the women were rude when I told the I didn't want to pay a dollar for cilantro and onions (2 of the cheapest things at the grocery store)... Seriously though... Almost 7 dollars for 2 half assed bean and cheese tacos with cactus is a complete joke. I'm never going back... There are better tacos for better prices almost anywhere else nearby. Chapala or Casa Maria... Well pretty much anywhere but this place.",1.0 star rating
"Restaurant is very clean and the staff is very attentive.  Whether its dine in or to-go, it won't disappoint.  A few of the menu items that are our usual favorites:  huevos rancheros, caldo, menudo, chopped chuletas, chicken mole... and sometimes we just get a la cart tacos:  beef fajitas (I get mines with just onions and bell peppers), chorizo and bean... I'm getting hungry now... I've heard great things about their burgers but just feel weird about ordering a burger from a Mexican restaurant.  I've been eyeing the ""Mexican Girl burger"" and think I'm gonna try it next time!!! Happy eating!",5.0 star rating

"Great breakfast had the veggie omelet , server was friendly and service was fast he brought out two kinds of salsa and they were both excellent I could almost drink the one it was so good I'll defiantly be back",5.0 star rating
"Mariana's reminds me of a place you cruise to on a budget or when day drinking and you need a Mexican food fix. Great service gives me the urge to give this place an average score. Food quality and portions lack strongly though. Salsa is straight up water with red food coloring. Pancakes were harder than Dwayne Johnson in a cage match. Ranchero sauce had no flavor at all. All and all, need a quick fix just to remind you of home, good place, but I wouldn't bring my out of town friends here.",3.0 star rating
"I love going to Mariana's! I know their major food is Mexican food but they have the very best burgers and fries. Fresh meat and fresh French fries! So yummy. The staff are so friendly and make you feel very welcome. Great salsa and chips, too!Thank you",5.0 star rating
"I came by for breakfast one morning with a group of 4 people.  It was breakfast time so when we walked in their sing read, ""Seat yourself""   We sat down and when we walked in we noticed no one welcomed us to the restaurant.  There were a couple of servers walking around plus the kitchen help and we could see them all as we walked in.  Now, the place is big with a high sealing.  Also, it's nicely decorated with Mexican hats and family pictures and pictures of their old location.  My review will be fair based on what our group had to eat.  2 of us had their migas plate, 2 other people had their machacado plate.  We all talked about our experience and we agreed the food had flavor.  Our plates came to our table almost room temperature while the tortillas came nice and hot.  The potatoes they serve are called ""papas guisadas"" which come with tomatoe liquid.  They were OK except the plate didn't get but maybe 3 or 4 on the plate.  We had coffee to drink.  The server never checked on us to ensure everything was OK.  Also, we sat there until we requested our check.  The server NEVER asked if we wanted anything else.  I know this is a family run restaurant but I think they need major training in restaurant/business etiquette.  Prices are OK ($7 or $8 a plate).  As I said, I liked the flavor of the food.  Kudos to Mariana the cook.  The servers need to invest in server training if they want to compete with other local restaurants in the area.",3.0 star rating
"Finally tried Mariana's for breakfast at their Austin location. I'm a little confused about why my husband raved about their San Marcos location because the food here was underwhelming and not what we are accustomed to from growing up in South Texas. The beans had no flavor and tasted like they had been refried in water. If Taco Cabana's beans taste better there's a problem. The ranchero sauce was very bland. Campbell's tomato soup is more exciting than this mediocre stuff. The most disappointing thing was the tortillas were not homemade, only because this place had so much hype. To me that's the line of a remarkable Tex-Mex restaurant versus one not mentioning. Not terrible, but not worth the calories and money.",2.0 star rating
Marianas beef nachos are delicious.The serving size of nachos is huge for the price.. The carne guisada is very tasty.  Their hamburgers are huge. Havent tried but i will next time. Havent had anything that i do not like. Their prices are very reasonable. The service is good.,4.0 star rating
"Very clean restaurant and friendly staff. I've only been here once, but I definitely would return. The menu is your normal Tex-mex, serving tamales and burgers, but they make sure your order is correct and bend over backwards to make you feel at home.",5.0 star rating
"I've been coming here since it was a tiny shack on Burleson Rd. I love it!!!  The staff is attentive and quick. The food is perfect!  Barbacoa tacos are my favorite. And the Menudo soup is fantastic!  I also love the salsa!  Excellent taste. Not too spicy but just enough kick. Definitely eat here, quick, easy, and tasty!",5.0 star rating

"Absolutely love this place!. Mariana's has become a weekend tradition for my little family. We go there about once a week , My daughter frequently requests Mariana's breakfast because they are so darn good, and the closest yet to a good home cooked breakfast. We have also came for lunch which is also delish. The staff are all amazing I can't say enough good things about them all. Very awesome family feel with them all. The food is always on point and at a very reasonable price about $1.85 or less. Plates range in price I love the chorizo & Egg plate which is about $6ish. Not too shabby. Lunch is also very good, I have tried to enchiladas and carne guisada so far. Both very good in flavor. They are self seating when you walk in, And will approach you in no time to give you menu's on top of taking your beverage orders for starters. This place I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone to try at least once, that's all it will take to get you hooked.",5.0 star rating
"My husband loves this place. Thus, I have been here quite often. I, however, am not as big of a fan. The prices are great! They have great lunch specials. The food is alright. I think the thing I enjoy the most are the french fries, kinda sad isn't it? Everything here is just average. The service is about the same. Nothing exceptional. They all kind of just stand around until you catch their attention. They aren't very proactive.",3.0 star rating
"(#79)...Sometime you get lost in daily life and forget to do a review..but its never to late..Although only 9 reviews...all seam to be good, but this place just fell flat on flavor...We have dished out our fair share of beans and rice...First time I have Ever added salt to a Mexican Dish...wife went the usual route on beef enchiladas...and nothing special at all...Mine was the huge combo plate...lots of food..on 2 plates..Everything seamed to taste the same, no difference fromone sample to the next..did I mention it needed salt...The one thing that stood out to me was the salsa..fresh, spicy and good..On to the next adventure..",2.0 star rating
"Decent food. This was my first time having breakfast at this restaurant, I had heard good things from co-workers and family members. The prices are very reasonable, the service was to be expected in a small establishment with three servers, a bit slow and not very accurate with our order but friendly enough.",3.0 star rating
"Just ordered a 'TexMex burger' to go  , here cuz of Yelp. However, it's clear they specialize in Tex Mex food , by the aroma. Ordering was painless , menus are right behind the checkout area. 8.82 for a burger, fries, and drink. They place is quite spacious and there's Hispanic music playing softly in the background. 3 Tvs strategically placed. Big windows to observe I35 traffic. The do serve alcohol. I ordered tea and it's VERY sweet.. Changed to half /half. The burger was good, nothing special. Had jalapeños, avocado, & normal burger stuff. Tasted freshly made. The fries were below par. I didnt eat them all, not because I was full but because they weren't that good. I use a crap load of napkins no matter what I eat and I have plenty left over, so bonus points!",3.0 star rating
"Love this place! Breakfast, lunch or dinner I would recommend you try at least one! NOTE:If you go during a busy time you will have to wait. The food is worth the wait! I love the enchiladas rancheros!",5.0 star rating
"Perhaps it's because I went on a Saturday morning, but the service was atrocious. Very, very slow. The guacamole was very bland and our queso came out cold. The breakfast tacos were just alright, but totally not worth all the waiting. The good thing though, is that it is cheap. Two of us with all of the above was just over $10. So if you value just okay Mexican food more than your time, this is your place.",2.0 star rating
This place is special to me.  It's been a recent tradition to enjoy breakfast or brunch with my children here.  The wait staff is the best.  And the food is always delicious.  It's home cooking for me and I always have a smile when I'm at this fine dining establishment.,5.0 star rating
"Standard Tex-Mex fare. Our plates came out at different times. There seems to be a lot of juggling going on in the kitchen and if you sit at the bar you can see why. It was fun to watch all the viejitas hustling, frying, and refrying in the kitchen.  I have a feeling this place will do well because of its old clientele and the location.  The Deluxe plate is good if you want a little taste of everything. It came with a crispy taco, guacamole salad, one chalupa, one tamal, cheese enchilada, rice and beans., Did I mention that it comes in two huge plates? What was I thinking? Couldn't finish it, but it cured my hangover. The mole plate was surprisingly decent and came out way later after my plate came out. Queso was standard good and the salsa was the same.  Plus one star for playing Mexican music and not salsa.",4.0 star rating
My husband and I really like this place. The quality of their food is impressive. I like how they serve their seared tuna specialty dish. I've eaten here many times over the years with a variety of dietary restrictions ranging from vegan to low-carb and I've always really enjoyed myself here. I like all of the sushi I've tried here and their wasabi and fresh ginger. Sometimes they have a live DJ who plays house music - DJ Jaime. Both the tunes and the quality of the fish are kind of surprising given Umi's unassuming location and reasonable prices. This place is definitely casual. It's just a cool place to come enjoy some fresh sushi with friends you don't need to impress.,5.0 star rating
"Worst. Service. Ever. Our waiter looks and acts like he wake and bakes daily. One remaining brain cell left and he's struggling to hold on to it. Bless his heart. He can't get our orders correct or anyone around us. It also took 40 minutes to get our drink to us.To his defense, the ""manager"" watched him the entire time and just let him drown. He did not once offer to help. There were random employees that would come out of the wood work to answer a phone or hand over a to go order. Everyone was clueless as to the lack of service going on all around us. Nobody thought to help this poor guy out? Strange, just strange.",2.0 star rating

"The food here is incredible and full of flavor! I get pepper tuna sashimi at every place I go and to this was the best. The unique combination of sauce with the sashimi and seared flavor is an experience in itself. And then when the rest of my food came I enjoyed the rolls so much that I wish I could have handled eating more of them. My favorite part of my experience here was my server, Lina. She was so attentive and helpful to let me try something new. She is a star and deserves a raise! I will come back here next time I am in ATX with the hopes she is working and for some more of that incredible food!",5.0 star rating

"Tried Umi for the first time and our experience was good overall. Located I  the lowes plaza off of 35 in south Austin.Waitress was attentive.  Prices are comparable to other sushi places in town, however price needs to match quality. We came during happy hour and their specials weren't that much off the original price. For two people our bill was over $100. Sushi rolls - Great presentation and freshSiumai dumplings - for sure the frozen kind and not fresh - skip on those Spicy garlic edamame - delicious, but priced about $2 more over non seasoned edamame?Cocktails are a bit overpriced and lacking....would only order during HH.",3.0 star rating

"When you go out to eat you can have great service and bad food and it automatically makes your experience better and vise versa where you have great food and horrible service that ruins everything. Not here. Our waitress Angelique was so helpful, friendly, and informative. She made our dinner a great experience. Not only that but the peppered tuna was delicious. Not if but when me and my family come back to Umi. I will request to be sat in her section. She was so kind to my two children where my one year old daughter wanted to go with her lol and that saying something for my daughter she doesn't like anyone she doesn't know.  The only thing I would request is that who ever makes the drinks learn to make a Long Island ice tea. I ordered on and it didn't taste anything near what it should. But even with that my experience was great!",5.0 star rating

"We went for breakfast.  Ordered the chips and salsa, coffee, water, and two menus as soon as we arrived.  Did the waitress tell us that the chips and salsa cost $2.50 before 11 am?  Nooooooo.  Service was slow, coffee was cold, and chips and salsa weren't that good.  We ordered the Migas Especiales with beef fajita meat.  Reviews made it sounds really good.  Noooooo.  Not much egg; most chips, sauce, and overcooked veggies.  And instead of putting the fajita meat on the side it was chopped up and put in the migas.  If it had any flavor before that, it lost it in the cooking of the eggs.  Second round of coffee arrived, and at least it was hot.  All in all, I'm not sure why people say this place is great.  I found it to be barely acceptable.",2.0 star rating

I've been eating breakfast tacos from San Jaunitas for almost 20 years now! They have the best breakfast in south Austin! To be honest I've never eaten lunch or dinner there just breakfast! Even my wife of 3 years who moved from Leander to south Austin loves the breakfast .....reminds her of her mother's!,5.0 star rating
"I had the breakfast tacos here. Ordered the sausage, potato, and egg. Solid! Terribly hot inside. I felt like I was cooking and not the food. Also, cleanliness doesn't seem like a priority because it's pretty dirty. I'm not sure how I feel about coming back due to the cleanliness issue. They do have other breakfast options if breakfast tacos are not your thing.",3.0 star rating

Love the brisket and rice tacos! Pretty much all the breakfast tacos are really good and the main reason why we come here for breakfast multiple times a week.   Tortillas are not fresh but the food itself makes up for it. Salsa is really spicy but good if you can handle it. Oh and make sure you sit by the AC if you want to eat comfortably.  Its really hot in there otherwise!,4.0 star rating
Crap food..! I live nearby and used to go to Villa Mexico all the time. This place I have tried several times. Breakfast tacos soggy potatoes.  Lunch- ask for carne asada & get beef brisket with again soggy potatoes. Dinner-beef enchiladas red sauce nasty super dry bean and rice...  Again each time food is crap... Don't bother..!!!,1.0 star rating

"I've only had their breakfast tacos and they are Y U M M Y! I've ordered the chicken fajita tacos which are to die for, bean and cheese taco which is good, and egg, cheese, and potato. They sure do over do it with the eggs on these tacos. They put mountains of eggs on the tacos and only small amounts of potato or meat. But they are still good. Wish they had more sauce other than red. They should look into getting green sauce. Service is OK. The Mexican chick at the counter can be pretty short sometimes. Like I went in today and bought a couple of chicken fajita tacos. When it was done she just flopped the bag on the counter and turned away. The other lady doesn't even speak English of course but she's nice. I plan on going back for their lunch menu and trying some enchiladas some time soon.",5.0 star rating

"On a whim last night we decided to finally check out this little taco truck on our way home from being out and about at 2ish in the morning.  We pulled up and I knew by the amount of people hanging out that this was probably a good spot.  Boy did I guess right!We ordered the barbacoa and pastor tacos.  The barbacoa was good, but the pastor was even better!  I then ordered an additional pollo (chicken) taco and it was super delicious too!  The tacos were only $2.00 a piece, which is not bad at all.  We ended up taking two extra pastor tacos home with us for our house guest to try.  We also got 2 Mexican cokes to really hit the spot.  The green sauce they are clearly making themselves was perfect!  They top all the tacos with an onion and cilantro mix.  I am not a huge fan of raw white onions and thought it was too many so I picked some of the onions off, but kept some.  I love the flavor it was just overwhelming at first, but not a big deal at all.  My other half couldn't get enough onions on his, so he used what I picked off.  Anyway if you are in the neighborhood and happen to see this little taqueria near the stassney and congress intersection, by the hispanic night club lounge I would definitely recommend stopping for some tacos!  I am looking forward to try some of the other options they have and other menu items.",4.0 star rating

"Terrible dining experience. There was no happy hour today since it was the Mother's Day, the waiter refused to accept Groupon offer either. It would make sense if the restaurant was packed, but there were only 4-6 tables.The booth was absolutly disgusting, table was sticky with soy sauce spills on it. The waiter was inconsideate, kept coming back for orders (Why couldn't he just take all of our orders at once?) We also had to wait for him to get refills on our drinks.Teriyaki chicken plate was the WORST I have ever had in my life, chicken was very dry and the sauce was plain soy sauce with stirred fried veetables on the side. For $13 a plate, it was even worse than Panda Express's teriyaki chicken. so save you bucks before ordering this.Fried chicken appetizer was plain, okay maybe it wasn't that plain. Let me reword it as plain salty chicken. Come on, chicken is not that hard to make.We wanted to give dessert a try, it was terrible too. Banana tempura with Matcha icre cream was terrible, felt like I was at Golden Corral. Matcha ice cream had absoluely no green tea flavor, fried banana was plain and soggy.Only reason I did not give one star was because of the Go To Hell Roll, It wasn''t the best but it was ediable.",2.0 star rating
"Austin is definitely not the city to visit for Sushi.  That being said out of the 6 or so places I have had sushi this is by far the best.  There is a wide variety of sushi rolls and some of them are even a bit creative in a good way.  It is a little pricey but no different from any other sushi place in Austin.I am really confused by the staff's attire.  The men wear black slacks with a Umi Tshirt, the women are dressed to put it politely in club clothing, things like knee high boots with black fishnet stocking, booty shorts and then a Umi Tshirt worn provocatively.  I don't have an issue with the attire itself its more of if the women are dressed to be objectified so should the men.",4.0 star rating

"We went for lunch on a Saturday and everything with the exception of the waiter was disappointing.  It is a very overpriced place with Manhattan prices and Austin quality.   Austin quality means a ""locally trained"" sushi staff. Where it takes years to be permitted to make sushi in Japan in Austin you can do it in a few hours and charge the same prices.  The way they get around this is by pushing rolls where nobody knows what they're getting. We  ended up eating rolls which had cute names but weren't any good. Real sushi is not fake rolls but very fresh fish put together by experts. This certainly is not the case at  Umi. If this is what sushi is like in Austin I would not stray from the barbecue  and breakfast tacos where you have a track record. Eat what is locally good and not bad imitations.",1.0 star rating

However, the reality? It only comes with 6 skinny slivers of sushi!....Why do you even show extra rolls in the photo?  Why don't you say how many rolls comes with each order in your description?

Rolls were great-- we had two our waiter recommended, the Obake and Crouching Tiger. Both were delicious!However, the service was slow.

"We dropped in very late one afternoon and just missed the lunch menu, so ended up ordering from the dinner menu. It was prep time for dinner, so our dining was accompanied by a less than melodious incessant chopping. I noticed a DJ booth and a dance floor, so this restaurant no doubt sees some evening action that we missed out on that day.The wait staff was friendly and very accommodating, and the food was decent. The location is a little odd, tucked in a strip mall, and the dinner prices are a little higher than one might expect for the location and dark atmosphere. However, I'd recommend checking it out for lunch and then perhaps hitting them up for happy hour, when the DJ booth is bound to be occupied and rocking.I feel like I missed out on both, so I'll most likely try again the next time I'm hanging out on I-35 South.",3.0 star rating
"My friend and I came here last week and both got bento boxes. I got the salmon teriyaki dinner bento.The good:-It tasted good!-Came with miso soup and a salad. -Server was very nice and attentive.-Place was clean and had a nice interior.-You can order a bento at any time of the day. Many places only serve them for lunch.-Tempura red bean ice cream was really good!The bad:-I can only say this for the dinner teriyaki salmon bento box, but it seemed a bit overpriced to me. It was $20. There are other restaurants in Austin (like Hanabi ($12) or Ichiban ($11.95)) that have equally delicious teriyaki salmon bentos with the same amount of (if not more) food in each  bento compartment. -They don't serve lunch bentos on the weekends, so you have to get the pricier dinner bentos even if it's lunchtime. Would I come back for a bento? Probably not, considering there are other places with good bentos for cheaper. However, eating at Umi was a good experience and the food was tasty!",3.0 star rating

"Came with hubby and two elementary kids and they sat us in the bar. Normally I wouldn't care, but the waiter on that side seemed pretty annoyed never brought us two more napkins/chopsticks till we had to ask for them after our appetizer came. They do not have a kids menu or options of smaller portions. So I just got an adult portion and split between my kids which worked out. Food was pretty good when we got it, but it took a really long time for everything to come out. We had to ask for plates as they just brought the rolls out without any. The plates were tiny (which is ok for sushi) but when our main course came that we were sharing family style  you could only get about two bites worth on the small plates. So with all that said, food tasted great (spicy tuna tacos were my favorite, but didn't get them till we asked for our check and it's an appiyizer), service was pretty horrible. Probably wouldn't go back cause of it.",3.0 star rating

"Spent a year in south Austin and recently moved to another part of town, and San Juanita will easily be the south-side restaurant I miss the most.This place is so very much the real deal . Co-located in a state inspection / body shop, the building is covered with ridiculous lo-fi murals - I can't decide if the frog strangling the crane, the arm-less woman in front of Niagra falls, or the Butt-Head-style rendering of Willie Nelson is my favorite.Charming servers bring you luscious staples -- Huevos Divoricados is my favorite, complete with a large slice of candied ham. The guisada lunch special, or the adobo pork ... both have a special place in my memory.

"Out of curiosity, I braved San Juanita (the post-apocalyptic, Spahn Ranch-esque shanty of a place on S. Congress/Stassney), thinking there must be a hidden gem in there. No place this scary looking could stay open unless there is something special going on. Well, there isn't, unless it's something I don't know about. Human trafficking? Meth lab? I watch too much Breaking Bad. Anyway, the whole place smells like burned fish--and everything tastes like it, too. Nothing seemed clean. My salsa bowl had crust on it. The salsa was from a can. My glass had a lip imprint on the rim. I half expected a goat to come wandering through the dining room. I played it safe and got crispy tacos, and if they hadn't already absorbed the burned fish bouquet, I would still say they were the worst I have ever had. This is what Tex Mex tastes like in hell.I did it so you won't have to. Believe me, it's a gift.",1.0 star rating

We were looking for a good breakfast place. He wanted pancakes and I wanted a good breakfast regardless of where/what. Yelp showed hill cafe had 3 stars and I trust us yelpers so I saw San Juanita's had a better rating and we opted for more stars than pancakes. Guess what? Juanita's had pancakes and french toast!!

"Good and CHEAP!! I live right around the corner and I go here a lot. The migas here sooooo good. They're full of not just eggs, cheese, and chips but peppers and jalapenos and I like to mix a little of the beans in there. Breakfast tacos are very good. Tortillas are soft, not stale like some taco joints by my job that shall remain nameless. Barbacoa was very tender, egg n bacon taco is always outstanding, and the salsa is great. Some folks say the salsa is inconsistent here and I will agree with that but in a good way. I kinda like that some days it's garlic-y and some days more spicy, if it's different all the time then to me that means they're churning out fresh batches all the time. I don't eat manudo my brain can't get behind the idea of tripe, but my Dad loves it at San Juanita's they make it fresh every Sunday and when he gets it I usually have some of the broth because it's so good. My ONLY complaint, and I hate to do it because I love these girls that work here they're friendly, they tolerate my flirting, and they're bilingual for my non-espanol speaking puerto rican ass, but OMG this place needs help with the coffee. It's ditch water coffee. It's baaaad. HOWEVER, I do live around the corner just a 5 min walk so the ladies always let me bring my home made cafe con leche in here to drink with my own mug. I think they know how bad the coffee is lol. Other than that it's a great place with awesome tacos that are really cheap.",4.0 star rating

"We drive by this place all the time - it's on the southeast corner of Stassney and Congress.  The exterior yellow paint looks like it used to be sunshine bright, but has now faded with time.  It appears to be a tiny shack, a step up from a taco stand.  We'd always say, ""One day we'll go to San Juanita - before it gets replaced by an Office Depot.""  And so we did.Upon walking in, we knew we were somewhere special.  It was a bit larger on the inside than appeared from the outside.  The floors were concrete, the tables were covered in colorful oilcloths, and the TV was blasting terrible Saturday morning Mexican game shows - you know, with scantily-clad women doused in foamy soap.  Although most of the customers appeared to be Mexican families from the neighborhood, there was still a diverse clientele. The menu explained that San Juanita has always been family owned and that the daughters who work there will get to know your name and what you like to order.  It's true - Paloma took our order, and she made us feel as if we were welcomed guests in her home.The menu was none too exciting - standard tacos, enchiladas, and gorditas (they do serve menudo on Saturdays).  To try one of the more exotic things on the menu, I had the carne guisada - the rice was cooked to perfection, the refried beans were flavorful, but the meat was a bit tough.  I'll go back there, not so much for the food, but for the genuine, family-owned atmosphere.  And the game shows on the TV.  (Just kidding.)p.s. they do take MC and Visa.",5.0 star rating

"Health inspector, please take notice.In the wake of all the health issues from Chipotle, and their time off to re-train people, I assumed they would actually run a tight ship now.I worked at a Subway for 4 years while in high school and college, I know a thing or two about cleanliness in fast-food chains.  It's not hard, you just use common sense and practice a little empathy.I went in to get a burrito around 7 PM on Sunday.  Place was pretty empty; no line, 2-3 tables with people at them.The assembly line had 3 girls working, and it looked like the guys in the kitchen were doing tear-down and clean-up.For some reason 2 of the girls on the assembly line left as soon as I went to place my order.  So the girl who was operating the grill warmer heated up my burrito, then went to clean something... putting her gloved hands on some sort of mop / squeegee thing... as soon as she was done cleaning she apparently got tired of waiting for the other two girls to come back so she started making my burrito.  She didn't change her gloves.I'm like... uh, whatever, this is gross... how do I get out of this?She proceeds to use her gloved hand to wipe off the counter... old sour cream, whatever else, pushes it into the trash -- no rag (not sure if that would make it better), just the same glove.  Then moves my burrito down the line.When she gets to the cheese she scoops the cheese with the same glove.  Then she proceeds to roll my burrito, touching my tortilla with the same glove... Anyway at this point I knew I wasn't going to eat that.  I just mumbled something about not having my credit card and walked off. This place needs a better manager, one who will apply and enforce some common-sense cleanliness standards.  If you touch something other than food, change your glove.  When I worked at Subway, my manager would have fired us over shit like that.  I remember getting bitched out because I didn't change gloves between making two different customer's sandwiches once, I still remember my manager yelling at me, ""Your gloves aren't there to keep your hands clean, they are there to keep the customer's food clean!  WTF?!  You're done for the day, clock out.""Fucking disgusting that they have such low standards.  Won't be back again.",1.0 star rating

One of the worst places I have ever been! Will never go back! Staff was rude and argued with me about an order that I placed with a separate person that left and went on break. Manager didn't even know how to give me my money back. He had to get help from the cashier.,1.0 star rating

"This location needs to teach the two female cashiers to stop being so judgmental, I swear they had a negative comment for every person there. No discretion what so ever...fire these bitches! Well the food was good but the judgmental queens taking cash and passing out the guacamole and chips need to be talked to about how to treat customers.",1.0 star rating
When I don't feel like driving to my FAVORITE chipotle location on South Lamar I'll stand this location as a back up. Every time I've come here I noticed their chicken and bell peppers always taste burnt and their ingredients have little to no flavor. Like all chipotle's they skimp on the portions and you have to ask for more rice or beans. They should really teach their servers to stop that and give us hearty scoops. But most of all quit burning the chicken and bell peppers.,2.0 star rating
"I come to this location at least 2 times a week. Not only am I always satisfied with my food, but they go above and beyond with the service here as well. In my most recent visit, I came in later, around 9:30 a little before closing. So I already felt bad coming in so late, but they happily fixed me my tacos and even gave me a free burrito coupon for next time I come for no reason! Then I go to get my drink and an employee stopped what she was doing and got me a lid, straw, and napkins just to be friendly. Just exceptional service.",5.0 star rating

"I really like Chipotle. Just kidding, I love it. I hardly ever am unhappy leaving one. This location just rubs me the wrong way I guess. It's always something. No steak. We didn't receive your online order. I ask for pico and they put the hot salsa on it. Huh!?! Chipotle is good, and I used to live in South Austin so I understand this may be the only option. But if for some reason you live equally far away from 2 chipotles, or maybe slightly closer to this one, I urge you to find another! Sorry guys.",3.0 star rating

"This was my first visit to this place. I'll start with the positive. Our Server was very attentive and apologetic. So our experience did not impact his tip.  A small menu to chose from which I don't mind. Generally means good food since there's less to execute. There was three of us for lunch. Once we ordered, it was 20 minutes before food made it to the table. It was my extra hard cheese enchilada. Just that mind you. It was another 25 minutes before all food made it us. I was nearly finished with mine before my son got his plate. They brought one item at a time. The server was clearly upset and embarrassed about the situation. The kitchen (which you can see into from the dining area) was clearly under performing. Nice place but something needs to be done to improve the quality of food and its production. Somebody let me know when that happens so I can give them another chance.",2.0 star rating
"I think this place is soooo good! The meat in the tacos are just amazing! I ordered the deluxe plate and I wasn't able to finish all of it but it had a little but of everything. My favorite thing was the tacos, tamales, and the charro beans. The enchiladas and the rice were OK but what stood out was the salsa. It was super spicy to me but the boyfriend loved it. Went in around 2PM so it wasn't busy. Got decent/good service since our table was the only for a while. Service was above average for this experience but this review is mostly for the food which was super!

This restaurant is  truly authentic. My family and I come to this restaurant at least 2 a month. It's a family owned restaurant. When my family and I first came to this restaurant we thought we saw some familiar faces and it was true we have seen this family before :) they use to have another restaurant called La Reyna. Omg soooooo delicious I would always have their beef enchiladas! Sad news they closed that restaurant down years ago! But it is so nice to see his family again and back in the food business. The food is amazing! Seriously everything on the menu is worth trying! Of course my favorite is the beef enchilada! :),5.0 star rating
"First timers. Got beef enchiladas and 1 cheese. They were pretty average unfortunately. Made some at home better. Beans were watery and the rice wasn't fluffy..taco cabanas rice and beans are better. Got small queso for $3 which was really good. Salsa was a lil too hot for us, chips were good. Tortillas didn't seem to be homemade. He got the flautas and they weren't crispy enough (taco cabana is betteR). Staff was nice but were a little slow. Overall, totally average place unfortunately..nice inside and I liked that it wasn't packed like casa Garcia's always is, but it guess there's a reason for that too..",3.0 star rating

"This location had been going downhill for a long time. My husband and I used to love eating there then the food wasn't made the same and it was all sort of gross. We went a week or so ago and it had a sign up that it had new owners it managers, whatever. The food was okay, I was going to order dessert when we looked at the booth walk and there was a small cockroach hanging out. I squished it then got the check and we left.

And if it was just lack of politeness that turned us off, I wouldn't be giving it a two star rating. The food, while seemingly appealing, upset both of our stomachs as soon as we got home, leading me to believe the ingredients were either not fresh, processed or improperly cooked. I got the Southwestern chicken salad with steak instead. Delicious cilantro lime dressing, but the steak was undercooked, and instead of black beans, they used weird brown beans. $11.99 + $2 extra for steak. All in all, our upset stomachs cost us over $50 for a burger and a dinner salad!!  In my opinion, if you happen upon this place, just keep driving!!",2.0 star rating

How could someone not see that when setting the table? We had to ask our waiter twice for clean plates. If this is what is visible on the table for a guest when first walking in, really makes me question the cleanliness of what you don't see in the kitchen. We had to hunt down our waiter several times and they were not extremely busy. Prices were very high for the steaks and service was slow/unfriendly. Our waiter was obviously not having a good night.

"Went there tonight for dinner. We're from out of town so we wanted a ""Texas"" experience. We were greeted friendly at the door and sat. Our server, Bree, was friendly and attentive. She refilled our drinks without asking, brought food out promptly, asked if we needed anything, etc. My issue really is with the management. When we were seated and brought drinks, there appeared to be a dead bug (maybe a fruit fly) floating in my fiancé's Mountain Dew. Bree apologized and brought us another. Then, we were brought bread. We went to cut it and realized the napkin that the silverware was rolled in was dirty/stained, as was the knife in it which had stuff stuck to it. We asked Bree for new silverware and she, again, apologized and brought us new silverware. At no point did we get mad or ask for management. Then, without us asking, we were informed by Bree that her manager would be coming over to talk to us. I got my starter salad, no manager. We got our dinner, no manager. Our plates were cleared, no manager. I finally informed Bree that he never came by and shortly afterwards, he appeared. When he came over, he kind of stood there and waited to see why he was there. When I said ""Bree said you were coming by but you didn't so I didn't know if there was a reason she said that"", he apologized for the dirty silverware and said he would make sure his dishwasher got everything off it from now on. We said okay, thanks. End of exchange.Now, I'm not one to typically complain but when our bill came out, we thought there may be some sort of compensation considering we had a less than desirable experience and were told the manager would come by without even asking then he never did. However, there was no compensation. Just saying, especially as out-of-towners who hear Texas people are the friendliest, we expected more.",2.0 star rating

"I stopped by this place on my way home, late on a weeknight, needing some dinner. I didn't have high expectations, being from out of town and this place looking like a chain outfit. I have eaten a lot of salmon in my life. I lived in Oregon and Alaska and have caught salmon, had it fresh, smoked, grilled, sushi, sashimi, and planny lomi lomi style in my Hawaiian homeland. I ordered a salad with the grilled salmon and rice pilaf (not sure if that's what they called the rice dish, but that's what it appeared to be). The rice was tasty, and a good companion to the salmon. The salad was fine, as well, with a decent lime cilantro vinaigrette. The salmon was maybe one of the best pieces of grilled salmon I've ever eaten. It had been cooked absolutely perfectly! I've cooked a lot of fish and eaten a lot more and it's not always easy to get right. I took a chance, and braced myself for overcooked/dry fish. However, and I hope the kitchen gets this note, that salmon filet was perfectly done. Tender and juicy inside, with some very tasty grill marks and crisp corners. The (minor) downside--The young lady who manned the front door was average at her job; I couldn't tell if her, ""It might be a wait..."" was said so unapologetically, because she wanted me to leave, or she had to fend off surly guests and was bracing herself for a potentially abusive response. Either way, wasn't a very welcoming greeting. And I almost gave up after 15 mins of waiting, despite the restaurant being less than half full. Much less.",4.0 star rating

"Went here on January 1, which I recognize is a holiday for most, and appreciate people working on a holiday but we just didn't have the best experience. Our waitress recommended we get the queso with the sirloin strips and the beef was just plain chewy.  I would've rather have had just queso. But our waitress was very kind and that stuff happens, so no big deal. My main issue was that they were prepping the tables SO loudly. I get it it was one hour till closing but the busboy was basically throwing the app plates on the tables so they did the loud clang and spin around until settled for probably like 6 tables. Was so rude and obnoxious when you have people dining in your restaurant (in the same dining area). Completely interrupted the conversation I was having. My boyfriend and I kept looking at each other like if he does one more table we might have to say something but we bit our tongues and eventually it passed. To top it off... what chain steak house doesn't give you bread with your meal. Wth!? Hadn't been to TLC since college. Prob won't go back again.",2.0 star rating

"We came here for a retirement luncheon recently (about 8 people) and this was my first time ever eating at a Texas Land & Cattle.  Previously, I had only ever been to a happy hour for drinks with a friend and had a much better experience.  For starters, the server was SUPPPPER hung over. He mentioned something about going to a show the night before, which I totally get, but he was just not with it and looked like he really needed to go home.   My boyfriend mentioned what a great place this was for business lunches so I definitely had higher expectations.  True, I don't eat meat but I could still see what everyone else at the table ordered and ate, no one was really that over the moon about their food.  My broccoli cheese potato which by their own description is ""stuffed with fresh broccoli, our Queso Blanco and melted Cheddar cheese"" was just a plate of sadness, I included a picture with my review. Their wedge salad was underwhelming too even for a chain restaurant the lettuce tasted old.

(We LOVE this place) As were ordering picking our food for the bowl...(Now my husband does not like his meat Pink)  so the last time we came he asked if they could cook it a little more &the  lady serving us said ""No Problem"" so, she wrapped it in foil & placed it on the grill. (Wa-la done) so today there's enough beef fajita for one bowl (I get chicken) so my husband asks ""Can you please heat that up for me"" & the server says No! He says ""Well its pretty much cooked as much as it can be, & its been there for a while, but not that long"" and makes us feel stupid for asking, and continues taking our order! So we sit down, start eating and the look on is face after his first bite..made me try it as well....Chewy, cold & disgusting. After I mentioned it to the cashier and the server, all they had to say was ""Really"" and ""Were sorry"" ?!? ....Really?!! 1st of all chipotle is not cheap, and if I'm paying at least $24.00 on food they could of easily said ""Sure"". The man in the back had just finished making a big silver pan of fresh meat...why couldn't he just say, ""Let me give you some fresh meat""I'm flabbergasted by his customer service & will mention this to my friends and family who love to eat there, it's your customer service that keeps people wanting to come back and that right there makes me now want to.

"This is my favorite Chipotle without question. The Congress location has the best carnitas - they're the only ones I know of who marinate the pork for an adequate amount of time. Still, I appreciate this particular Chipotle because of the employees. I'm always greeted as though I'm an important customer, and many times I like to exchange light banter if the line isn't long.The food here is great. It never changes. However, what I like about Chipotle is that they use naturally raised meats and veggies. I understand that this is only true to a certain extent, but I feel better eating here than any other fast food place.If you decide to eat at this location, throw a little greeting in there and you'll get a lot back in return.

That one particular time, i took it to go and got home which takes maybe two minutes and was going to eat it right then, the food was cold and not fresh at all..i continued to eat it but i did call just to let them know and when i called i ask for a manager and they guy said he is busy can i help you and i said im calling with a complaint and i'd really like to talk to him and he refused..i let him know the problem and he states ill let him know and hangs up and i was NOT even finished talking!But other than that i never had a problem i love there food and there white rice is the bomb!!!

It's a quiet spot and sometimes getting out again is a challenge in traffic, but the people are sweet, the manager is good to his folks, and I often see the same people working there for many months without super quick turn over. They always have a happy greeting and they recognize people who come there often.In the summer time, I often take an extra long lunch to sit outside in the sun and soak up some sunshine while eating and for a bit after. PS try adding a bit of both beans! it's great with chicken or pork!",4.0 star rating
"Love this location.It's usually not crowded (unless you go around noon) and the food is almost always delicious. The staff is the best part, they're all really friendly.My only complaint is about guacamole. Sometimes at Chipotle they try hard not to waste it (fine) but serve it as it's turning brown. Wouldn't be an issue if it weren't so expensive.",5.0 star rating
"Just had a really pleasant experience at this Chipotle! All the employees were in great moods and were friendly. I had to wait an extra minute because they were in the process of making fresh guacamole and they made it up to me. You could tell that the manager was well-trained in excellent customer service, practiced what he preached, and did a wonderful job of leading/inspiring his employees. I left with a smile on my face! Thanks guys!",5.0 star rating
"Just barely a 4 star rating.  I guess I prefer Cabo Bobs and Freebirds just a touch more, and each of them earns a 4 in my book.  Quality of the food is good, the portion size is nice too.  I'd prefer a couple more options, like those that Freebirds offers, or a little more of the variety, like Cabo Bobs offers, but for what they do offer, they earn a 4.  Service is as good as expected as well.",4.0 star rating
"Now I don't know if it's all Chipotle's or only the ones in Orlando, but cops eat 1//2 price there or maybe it was free.  I forget.  The reason I know is my brother is a cop.  So I would go on ride-alongs with him and we'd stop in at Chipotle when we'd get a free moment.So Chipotle is Chipotle.  The ones in Orlando look the same and almost taste the same.  It may have been a bad batch, but the steak here was BEYOND chewy.  Not enjoyable at all.  For paying $8.66 I was disappointed. I am not writing them off.  If you need to get food uber-fast, come here.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  I was shocked how fast they were.  Just maybe go with a choice other than the steak. Oh, you can order ahead online, but given how fast they are there is probably not too much point to it unless you getting several items.",3.0 star rating
"I don't care if it's a chain. I don't care if it was at one time owned by McDonald's. I don't care if a burrito has enough calories to last me 3 days.This place is delicious. And you know what? My Mexican friends agree (who'd have thought?). When they get back from a trip to Mexico, they have Chipotle cravings. I know, its ridiculous.Chipotle is swank decor and ambiance without the swank price. Great music playlist, and this spot in particular has a cool outdoor-eating area that overlooks a little creek.I kind of wish it  wasn't located on Stassney in the middle of apartment-hive-centrtal, but besides that its worth going to lunch to at least every other week.",4.0 star rating
"Great quesadillas. I absolutely loved them. Traditional Mexico City flavors. We had one in SA inside Ingram Park Mall, (only reason I would go to the mall), but they closed it down for some reason. They condensed the food court quite a bit, so that could be why. Anyways, a must try spot if you're in the area, and if you're not, but want great, very well priced quesadillas, come by. You won't regret it.",5.0 star rating
Great service as soon as we walked in the room. It was our first time trying this place. We just ordered the chicken quesadillas and they were sooo good. I'm not big on spicy stuff but even I couldn't decide which sauce was better (green or red). In my opinion they were both a little spicy but just enough to give it a kick. What I mean is they were both delicious. I'll be back for sure! Staff was also super nice.,5.0 star rating

In town for SxSW and staying nearby on Stassney. Found this gem close to Pizza Hut. So glad I stopped in and tried their tinga de res quesadilla. The corn tortilla was fresh and delicious.

"Will never eat here again. It is convenient and a nice building, but there is Mexican food just as good all over the place and the service here infuriated me to the point that I will never return.I was seated immediately. Only one other diner in the restaurant and he was finishing up. There were 3 or 4 servers standing around the bar, and one of them took my drink order. She returned with my iced tea and a menu and told me that someone would be around to take my order. I requested butter. Time passed and passed and passed. Finally, a lady came and took my order. She returned relatively promptly with my appetizer but forgot my request for butter. She returned again in a relatively short while, put my entree on the table without looking at me, turned, walked away, and didnt look back when I asked about my butter. By the time I finished eating, she had disappeared and failed to return a single time to find out if everything was fine, re-fill my beverage, or bring my butter. She disappeared. I had been finished for probably 15 minutes when she appeared to wait on a family that sat next to me. My beverage glass had been empty for 20 minutes. I attempted to get her attention but she never looked at me. Now it was an experiment. Would she ever check on me?  I wanted my check. No. Another 10 minutes passed and she was not to be seen. It is not a busy restaurant mind you. The other staff were sitting around the bar. Just before I went to look for the manager, the mystery waitress walked across the room. I got her attention and asked for my check. She disappears again! Finally, after waiting another 15 minutes for a check, I approached a staff person at the counter and offered to pay. My ticket had never been run. I handed her some money. Left. Wont be back. This is irresponsible on the part of the owners who are offering a decent, but not outstanding product. I honestly don't have time for people who have no more concern for their customers than this.",1.0 star rating
Had lipstick stains that were NOT MINE on the coffee cup... BOTH SIDES OF CUP. So watch out they're not too good about either making sure they don't give you their own coffee they were drinking or they don't clean their stuff properly. After that it set my expectations way low and ruined the dining experience. Also food was bland but service was decent.,1.0 star rating

"Had dinner reservations with a group of 8 ladies on a busy Saturday night. The restaurant was accommodating to our party arriving a little later than our reservation time (we called to let them know).Beautiful interior.Our server let us know that it was a tapas style restaurant and was helpful letting us know how many people each dish would feed.We started with the salsa and guacamole tasting. One order was easily shared among 4 of us. I've never had lump crab meat on my guac- this is something we agreed we must do from now on (budget willing.) My least favorite was the almon and chipotle puree, perhaps because the puree was slightly sweet. To me those flavors didn't blend together.I liked all 4 salsas and that they were 4 different colors. The black salsa was the most unique and the yellow one may have been my second favorite.We shared 3 ceviches: Acapulco, Tiradito, and Poke de Atun. The fish all around was very fresh. It's hard to pick a favorite between them. I might lean towards the Poke de Atun just because I love soy sauce and there's a hint of it.At the table we shared 2 Arrachera entrees. At the server's recommendation we got tortillas and had it fajita style. He did not mention the tortillas were extra, but no one seemed to mind since we split the bill.That hangar steak with whatever marinade it was in, just melted in my mouth. The blue corn tortilla was the perfect vessel to eat it with. I had secretly wished I had gone for a cocktail over my safe choice of a class of pinot grigio. Not that my wine was bad, but the ladies that tried the sangria, margarita, and the watermelon-elderflower martini were very happy with their choices.Not a place that my husband would probably go for as the entrees were very small portions considering the cost.From what I've heard, their happy hour would be worth trying.",4.0 star rating
"+2 For the incredible elote appetizer - crack on a stick. +2 For the extraordinarily tasty skirt steak entree+1 For the sweet and refreshing margaritas-1 For the raw / uncooked tortillas-1 For the pre-made, pureed, and seemingly refrigerated, meager portion of Guac for $12. Serves 6-8 chips. Great spot, great location, great vibes. Seems like the menu was just a bit hit or miss this time.",3.0 star rating
"Note: my review is for their Happy Hour!I was reading multiple articles online about the best HH and I stumbled upon La Condesa. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by on a Wednesday afternoon and we were able to luckily get outdoor seating on the patio as there were only about three (maybe four?) tables available outside. We were promptly greeted by the waitress and both of us ordered cocktails off of their drinks menu which were half off during HH. We both got mojitos and beer.We also ordered food for the evening which included the guacamole tasting (came with 4 salsas and 4 guacamoles), elote (came with two pieces of corn), a pollo postizado taquito (came with one taco), and some type of meatball in a mole sauce (three average sized meatballs). Overall the food was average, nothing really stood out with the exception of the chicken taco. The chicken was absolutely delightful, bursting with flavor, accompanied with salsa and the perfect amount of acid. To be honest, it probably was one of the best tacos I've had in my entire life. Would highly recommend to try. Other than that, nothing was too memorable- but if you're looking for a place with a nice patio and a hip vibe during HH, La Condesa may be a good choice for you.",3.0 star rating
Overall a great atmosphere and great location but pretty average food.We started with the chips and salsas and Queso fundido. I really liked the smoky salsa and basically stuck to that with the chips and I think a Wizard made the Queso it was so good and stringy. I wish they had a couple more tortillas though because we ran out and that was a bummer. For entree I got the huevos rancheros which was decent. The sauce was tomato based and had a good smoky flavor but there wasn't many beans in there. Waiter brought me the wrong drink so I'm not sure what the Paloma is like but the Margarita is fairly solid.,4.0 star rating
I sat solo in the bar area where they offer a solid happy hour menu of drinks and snacks as well as full menu table service. Great crispy HH tacos - smaller in size but mighty in flavor: recommend the poke and squash al pastor tacos. Margarita has cactus lemongrass-salt rim for a unique flavor.,4.0 star rating
"Came in for a late reservation and tried to get seated early, but ended up in the bar. Despite seeing several open tables, the only table we were offered was in the middle of a walkway, no thank you. Bartender was nice, but a little grouchy. Oh well, maybe it was not her day. The food, they say, comes out as it is prepared. But every single dish we ordered came out within 3 minutes of each other. This was kind of a let down as it didn't really give us time to much on our appetizer. What we ordered:The salsa / guacamole tasting: definitely not worth it. All 4 quacs tasted almost the same and the salsas were somewhat bland. This is a spin-off of a traditional Mexican restaurant and the chips were not up to par. The poke tuna: came with two somewhat stale tostada chips. I ended up just eating the poke. This was ok but not great. The Mexican corn: this was fabulous, but i mean who doesn't love Mexican corn. You can get in on or off the cob. The Chile rellenos: amazing!! This was the best thing we had. They are not your typical chille rellenos, but the white sauce they are bathed in was amazing. All in all, it was good but not great. Don't know if we have a need to stop in again.",3.0 star rating
"I'll admit I expected this place to be more classic Tex-Mex and it appears to be going for something different. The venue and decor are more LA than Texas, and the menu has a lot of central Mexican dishes. The chips and quac were my favorite part of the meal, and they have a good beer selection. I was underwhelmed by the rest of the meal, which included a mole dish and hanger steak.",3.0 star rating
"Super cute downtown spot with patio seating. I'll start off by saying if you don't like spicy then this isn't your place... Another thing I can't stand about Mexican restaurants- I don't care how high end you are- charging for chips and salsa. They give you 4 samples of salsa, they are all just kinda ok. The guacamole didn't look like fresh avocado, more like a mix of real and the store bought stuff. Cocktails were $12-14 a pop. Boooo. The ahi poke was good but spicy. The hamachi was amazing but a very small portion for the price. Queso flameado was great- def get it. Our friend got the vegetables and she loves spicy food but she said it wasn't edible because of the heat. The boyfriend got the pork chop plate - insert Mexican name-with taters. It was good, meat was a little over cooked. If I ever go back it'll hopefully be for a happy hour and I'll get hamachi and flameado. But I'll probably never go back. There's too many other amazing places that offer these exact things plus a plethora of other amazing dishes.",3.0 star rating
"Food & drinks were good, but seating was terrible.   Refuse to seat outside.  Tables are so close to each other and it's middle of walkway on the street.  Maybe better if the fence is higher and more room between tables.  Guacamole sampler was very good and I would recommend to someone who hasn't tried here.  Was surprised full order of hamachi ceviche came out like two piece of sashimi(like what you get for hamachili at Uchiko).  It was pretty good, but didn't think was worth it for the ambience.",3.0 star rating

"when i can eat mexican and know with any reliability it will be good, i do.  i had been curious about la condesa after seeing their menu so straight from the airport we went for a light meal.service was good. attentive,informative staff willing to answer questions, give advice in terms of ordering, etc.my drink was ok. it didn't wow me for $12. i liked the description and was told it would be smokey but i couldn't sense that at all when itarrived. it wasn't bad; it just wasn't popping with the mix of flavors the ingredients suggested.the food was good but be prepared for the size. these are small plates for sure! my tostada de atún was gone in three bites however it had great, fresh flavor mixed with a fabulously crisp tostada shell beneath the tuna and pickled veggies. the fried shallots added a nice flavor and crunch.my friend's mushroom dish wasalso good but heavier with its thinkcorn meal base.  again, a nice mix of flavors.we decided to order chips and their traditional guacamole neither of which were outstanding. i've had better chips out of a bag from my local organic coop and the guacamole was just that: guacamole. to be fair, our server detailed the various ones available and we chose traditional;  maybe it was the lackluster chips that minimized the experience?all in all, the place was hopping on a friday night. we did get seated right away and the majority of the food was fine but to walk out paying $65 (including tip) for having consumed three appetizers and a drink struck me as overpriced but probably what i should have expected from the upscale area of town.",3.0 star rating
"SO UNDERWHELMING. Was super excited to have my bachelorette dinner here. Menu looked awesome. UNFORTUNATELY, thy decided to drastically change the menu and it was highly disappointing. Ceviche was essentially just soaked through in lime juice. Steak taquitos over cooked. And tune poke tostadas which surely lit my throat on fire. Was very expensive and teensy tiny proportions.

"Came here with my boyfriend for a weekend brunch. To my surprise, the restaurant wasn't busy at all despite being brunch hours. We were able to get a table right away.[Service]Service was pretty bad here which is why I took out one star. No one greeted our table for a while. So we had to ask for a waitress. It also took forever for the waitress to come get our order. Throughout our meal, the waitress went MIA so a bus boy was the one refilling our water cups. I don't understand why the waitress took forever to be available for us when there wasn't even a lot of customers in the restaurant.[Atmosphere]Casual atmosphere. I love the interior design here. The arrangement of the lightings are nicely done. There is a small staircase that leads to a separate bar of the restaurant. Noise level was moderate. [Food]My boyfriend ordered the huevoa condesa which is considered a staple dish here. He really loved it, and the portion was just right for him. I ordered the Cubanita without realizing that it was a hamburger. But to my surprise, it was pretty good. I thought the chips were too oily though.All in all, it was a pretty decent restaurant. However, they definitely need to train their employees better.",4.0 star rating
We chose to eat dinner here because we could get a reservation and it looked like a fun place with lots of options on the menu. All of the food was just mediocre. We ordered the guacamole sampling to start. I'm not sure what was in all of them but there was something that left a weird after taste. I ate the cauliflower steak for my main course and it was cooked nicely but once again I didn't like the flavors of the sauce and other things on top of it. Lastly we had a side of the tostones which were nice and salty but I didn't like the lemon dipping sauce that came with it.I'm only giving this place two stars because it had great service.,2.0 star rating
"This is probably one of our favorite spots in Austin. Anytime we visit we make a point to stop in for drinksand a delicious dinner. We obviously started out with the cubico, this drink is a Tobacco infused tequila, it has a volcanic salt rim and they go down so easily- watch out the tobacco can make you a little light headed if you drink it to quickly. Seriously the best drink ever!!!!!!   Once we quenched our tequila thirst we ordered ceviche and the guacamole tasting- yum and yum! Our server suggested the carrot salad, it was hard to believe that this seemingly boring carrot salad could possibly be his ""favorite thing on the menu!"" We ordered it based on his suggestion and it was awesome! This wasn't my favorite thing we ordered but it's pretty hard to compete with tacos, right? I have to confess, I have thought of this little salad often since that night. Something about the roasted carrots, the shaved carrots, marinated carrots, currants and yogurt dressing just worked! Do not pass on this dish, it is a perfect starter! Finally we moved on to the main event, time for tacos. I ordered the lamb tacos, my husband ordered beef. The lamb tacos were damn good. The lamb was so flavorful, the in house made cheese, creamy, smoky and so tasty. Topped with mint and hot sauce, I can't even deal, amazing. Don't forget about the street corn, simple and absolute perfection.  If you are looking for a healthy and interesting Mexican restaurant  look no further, this is your spot! Cheers!

"I have been to La Condesa on various occasions. On this particular occasion I was catching up with a girlfriend. If you aren't a drinker I would suggest their Aguafrescas because they are AMAZING. I went with the Pineapple Mint. You can't go wrong with any of them though.I ordered the Al Pastor Torta. It was a little spicy but I'm also a wuss on spice. Great flavor all around. What blew me away though was the Boca Negra. Flourless chocolate cake, chile de arbol, ancho, caramelized banana, brown sugar-banana ice creamThis too has a little spice but it pairs beautifully with the entire dish. I am a huge banana foster fan so the carmalized bananas was just icing on the cake. We've all had flourless chocolate cake but this is just heavenly!",5.0 star rating
"Y'all I hadn't been to la condesa in years, literally years. We went yesterday post Mother's Day massages (hey there milk and honey), and we were all blown away by the food and drinks. There's so many places now in Austin to eat it's hard to standout. But la condesa was just good ingredients, with well made simple dishes, and instagram- worthy presentation. Hard to beat. Sometimes simplicity does win. Often times at Mexican restaurants there's too much sauce or other ingredients added in, this was a refreshing change to the norm, to actually just have good quality ingredients. We love going to 2nd street but find ourselves eating at taverna a lot, glad this place got back in the game! Not to mention the cocktails were blissful as well.Thanks la condessa for an exceptionally good Mother's Day dinner-- we can't wait to go back!",5.0 star rating
"La Condessa must mean in Spanish the word ""disappointment"". We were really excited to finally eat at this restaurant, on the way to see one of our favorite bands at ACL live afterwards. So we walk in and I feel like I'm in a nightclub because the music (not Latin music) is banging like I'm at a club. We had to shout at each other the entire meal just so we could hear each other. We have reservations so we are seated promptly. We ordered guacamole but it needed some seasoning. I ask for salt and pepper (not seeing any at our table or anybody else's table) so 15 minutes later here comes our waitress with the small dish with salt on one side and pepper on the other side, there sren't any restaurants that I've ever visited that didn't have Salt and pepper on the table. There are only 6 main courses and when you order one of those six absolutely everything is a side dish including the tortillas that you must use to make tacos with them.So you get three street tacos on 3 inch corn tortillas so I know I'll be eating at the event later. Do you want some ""sides"" well it's seven dollars for half a cup of beans and six dollars for half a cup of rice so I can tell you I won't be coming back. If you get a main course, sides and you have to buy the tortillas because they are sold separately and you're guaranteed at least $45 per person. Not that it's a big deal but for little to no food it's not a bargain. They couldn't get us out of the place fast enough for the next reservation and the food was just mediocre. I've had tastier and more filling street tacos just about everywhere and with more ingredients.",1.0 star rating
"Great meal for one! I walked in on a Thursday night and got a table outside. The waitress was really friendly and had recommendations for me. I got the guacamole with chipotle and sliced almonds, and the lamb tacos.The Guacamole had some real heat and smokiness from the chipotles. I was skeptical about almonds in guac but it really worked. The crunch from the almonds and the kick from the chipotles elevated the already tasty guac.The tacos were the best I had in Austin. The tortillas were toasted over fire, so they were both toasty and charred. The lamb was super flavorful and juicy, with crumbly, tangy cheese on top.",4.0 star rating

It takes a lot for me to leave a review. Service is pretty poor. First off. If someone one orders a 20oz steak along with a salad and bread. THEY SHOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE SAME TIME. Allow someone to time to enjoy the steak in stages. It wasn't like it was a busy night. Just poor meal planing by the bar tender. Normally I don't like being pestered by the wait staff while eating. But I should not have to wait while needing something like a refill on water or drinks. The most expensive steak on the menu was par at best. Sorry.

"Several weeks ago I wrote a complaint about Texas Land and Cattle not accepting our gift card we received last Christmas.  After contacting the BBB, the Texas Attorney General and my review here, I eventually received a call from Joseph, the restaurant manager saying they were sending me a letter stating they would comp my next visit up to the amount of $50, which had already been paid for the original gift card and I could reverse the amount already charged to my credit card.  Yesterday, we again visited his establishment and enjoyed  our lunch.  There was a sign at the host station stating they do not honor their gift cards but there was a phone number where you could redeem your gift card.  It was not present during our original visit.  I  guess I should be more forgiving but it will be our last visit there.  If they had done this from the get-go, they wouldn't have lost our large Austin family as patrons.",2.0 star rating

"Had dinner here recently.  One of us had steak.  First of all, the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  We ordered our food and drinks.  The service we received was great.  The food was very good too.  My issue was with the server.  She offered several choices for sauces and they sounded good.  One of us took advantage of one choice.  The server didn't disclose that choosing the sauce I chose would cost extra.  I mean, it wasn't that much $ but for me was the point of it.  The extra charges were on my bill at the end.  At that point, I didn't want to make an issue since it wasn't that much.  I did leave with the feeling that the server should've been forthcoming in disclosing what would cost extra so I would know to expect the charge on my bill.  I usually don't eat here.  Now, I'm not sure if I'll be back.",3.0 star rating

I really respect their customer service as well. I called in an order to pickup on my way home from work, and my dumb ass called the N I-35 location instead of the S I-35 location. I was bummed and embarrassed, but they were so kind and accommodating. Obviously I will be a returning customer, but I'll be sure to save the correct number in my phone for next time.",5.0 star rating
"We came here on a whim and was not impressed. The food was average and we had to send back the steak twice! At a steak place! Luckily, our server was excellent and handled everything well. I would not recommend this place.",3.0 star rating
"I only gave this place one star because the service was good, our waiter, that's it. But this place is definitely not worth going to eat and spend a lot of money. If I'm gonna spend $20 on a plate I'll stick to Longhorn steak house. Our appetizer was cold had to send it back, the lemonade sucked, my steak and shrimp combo plate was cold. The mashed potatoes looked and felt like they were sitting for hours. Steak was warm not necessarily hot, the only thing that came out hot was the FREE BREAD. My Caesar  dressing on my side salad tasted sour. I haven't had a bad experience like this in awhile. The waiter was super nice trying but there was absolutely nothing I enjoyed about this place, especially the cost. Will not be returning.",1.0 star rating

Will most definitely be returning and would recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!",5.0 star rating
"This place has a pretty great happy hour from like 4-6pm that no one seems to be aware of yet. They got these $3 sliders you can get with smoked brisket and also a guacamole-type  dish called the ""avocado smash"" which was delicious. Two sliders and the smash is a perfect amount for a happy hour snack/meal. It seems a little less chain-restauranty than a Texas Roadhouse. The fireplace and cattle-themes in the dining area makes for a relatively cozy atmosphere or TVs with sports on by the bar which is pretty empty every time I've come so you'll get quick service. I'll be back for another happy hour round soon",4.0 star rating

"The worst meal in South Austin.  The quality of this restaurant has gone utterly down the toilet.  We have a few steak house style places we frequent on a somewhat regular basis, but decided that as we were celebrating our anniversary this week, we'd step it up a notch a go to Texas Land & Cattle.  I honestly can't remember a worse meal in a restaurant, especially for the outrageous price. I had the West Texas Stacked Enchiladas.  Imagine a pile of stale corn tortillas, layered with shredded brisket that got dried out and warmed up in a smoker, smothered in canned enchilada sauce, and topped with a rubbery fried egg; served with canned black beans and bagged Mexican rice.  If I was a starving college student and had whipped this up out of $1.59 worth of generic dented can goods and cooked it on a cracked hot plate, then I might have just choked it down and been glad to have found sustenance to keep alive.  Having paid $13 for this pile is the gastronomic equivalent to a hate crime; which right now, my stomach definitely hates me for trying to eat this meal. My wife's ribeye steak was passible for food, in that we could have purchased the same low quality meat from a grocery store for home use.   It wasn't terrible as far as cheap meat goes, but again, for these prices I expect at least the quality of similar, cheaper chain restaurants. Topped with a small amount of canned crab and dry asparagus, for only $7 more. The bread was good, on par with other restaurants.  The avocado smash was good, not $7 for 1/2 cup of guac good.So, if you're looking for good food, steaks, burgers, Tex mex and such, literally go anywhere else in South Austin.  If you really want to drop $70 on a dinner that tastes more like a 6 year old is getting inventive with a can opener, then you've found the promised land.",1.0 star rating
"The jinx continues!  When eating out, I am unable to get a steak that is cooked the way I want it...medium.  I know it's not the way I'm ordering it because my son orders his the same way and his are always perfect.  They did ask if I wanted another, my son was almost finished by that time so I said no.  The manager came by and apologised and said they would take my meal off the ticket.  Then she returned and surprised me with a to-go box with some of their smoked sirloin in it.  Nice move!  I had to bump them up a star for that.My jalapeno poppers and wedge salad were passable.  My son's steak sure looked good.",4.0 star rating
"If the Chipotle burrito was a person it would remind me of a Mexican-American, a chicano, born into poverty. Had it rough. Then got older and left the hood. Moved into the rich part. Lost its roots. Forgot spanish. Told his friends to call him Joe instead of Jose. He then married an uppity girl from Beverly Hills. He then told people his ethnicity wasnt mexican. He was Spanish. Well poor ol' burrito. Thats you. You were mexican once. then they said no more yellow cheese. they then stuffed you with white rice. and put black beans in you. they said no more to pinto. well sometimes they put pinto beans in you but nobody orders it like that. they then decide that they hate your mexican tortilla outside appearance. they decided to put you in a bowl. you burrito are no longer mexican. but you sure are tasty!!!! yummmy.",5.0 star rating
"I'm sure there's a reason I don't choose Chipotle when I have a list of places to go. Last night my hunger took over as I was on my way to a friend's house.  I thought I'd give it another try.  She said it was on the way; I knew it'd be fast.And it was. It's just okay. I mean, I wouldn't call it delicious, but I wouldn't call it horrible, either. I just had the burrito bol, no rice. I had to wait for the peppers to be sauteed up, which is fine becuase it means they were fresh. But it also meant they were still a bit crunchy in places.Customer service left something to be lacking, but it was fine for the establishment.  Can't say I'd be excited to be working there at 7:30 on a Tuesday, either.  I got my food. I got to eat. The Hunger Monster did not have to surface.I still probably wouldn't pick it if I had other choices, but if needed, it works.",3.0 star rating
Mid price range sushi restaurant. Great happy hour menu. Very happy with the food quality with what I paid for.Good place to hangout with coworkers after work. The lights can be brighter in my opinion though. Around $25 per person if you order 2 rolls and a drink (or something similar to that)Parking can be tricky. There's some free street parking after 7 in front of the restaurant. And there's a parking lot across the street you can pay to park.,5.0 star rating

"Finally got to try this place downtown! Came on  a Wednesday evening and it wasn't too packed and got seated right away. Very cozy and modern space. We had a great server. Happy hour is 3-7 and reverse happy hour start at 10. Even though I'm not a huge sushi fan, they have plated dishes. Mine did not disappoint!Starters- try the garlic chili edamame Cocktails- mangotini yumDinner- yaki soba noodles (best stir fry and balance of flavors I've ever had!!): the dish comes with chicken but asked to do beef (as I need my cow) and the chef accommodated ThANK YoU!!!

"Happy hour all day on Sunday at BarChi, and also free street parking- who can complain? Went here on Sunday at about 4pm, reservation won't be needed at this time it was pretty slow but that's ok! We received excellent and fast service the entire time we were there. I ordered the lychee martini to start and honestly, I did not like it at all. It tastes like pear syrup, not my thing but the waitor instantly came to check on me because he knew I was hesitant about trying it in the first place. I told him I really didn't like it so he swapped it out for a $5 house white which was a Chardonnay that day, delicious and high quality with generous portions. My husband ordered a $2.50 coors light. We started with the ceviche tostadas which were to DIE for. Came with 4 small tostadas for only $5.50. We then ordered the Austin roll and the Samari roll, both were phenomenal and super fresh. The eel sauce was especially tasty but I had them put it on the side because I wasn't sure about it. All around, great place for happy hour. Super cheap and friendly, fresh and delicious sushi right here in downtown Austin.",5.0 star rating
"I've been to BarChi so many times I can't even count it. I swear, the happy hour is bomb. The lychee sake is ridiculously good as are most of the Maki rolls. I personally love eating the shrimp crunch roll because I love shrimp and crab. I've also had the scallops, deep fried ice cream and different nagiri. Depending on what kind of things you like in your sushi, I can guarantee you will find something that satisfies your sushi craving perfectly. Aside from amazing food, the servers are super nice, the place is beautiful and the atmosphere is super chill. I usually always come in big groups here and we end up staying for around an hour to an hour and a half. Parking is all street side unless you park in a lot nearby for a fee but it's worth it!",4.0 star rating
"The happy hour prices are decent for a downtown sushi location. Putting that aside, the service was lackluster at best and the flavor was lacking in multiple fields. Sunday/2pm, not busy by any stretch. Wait staff seemed unsure about who was to wait in us, took over 5 minutes to be greeted. Server we received seemed to be preoccupied mentally and was very scatter brained, rarely around, whereas the rest of the staff was noticeable and their tables very content and happy. Tables that had shown up after us were already working on their entrees while we're still waiting for the rest of our appetizer Eventually things make it to our table, most of it is palatable, but certain areas left us longing for more, be it savory, salty, etc. By now our server has all but disappeared, no other server is noticing our nonverbal cues that we need attending to. We had to flag the nearest waitstaff member to grab our check and a box, she was kind and tried to explain the terrible service away for her co-worker, we get it, things happen, people get sick, family emergency, whatever.. but if you need to step aside during work, you need to tell your co-workers to fill in the void in your absence and not leave your tables hanging.",2.0 star rating
"Their happy hour is to die for. The deals you get on their happy hour menu is incredible. I come here often with my friends on Sunday because it's happy hour all day Sunday. First let me point out the amazing mood and ambiance here. It's dimly lit with nice modern furnitures. They have a sushi bar area and then an actual bar area. Pretty spacious and it's pleasant to be dine here. Let me also point out the clean restroom, it's a deal MAKER since bathrooms at restaurants downtown are small and such. Also at night, occasionally, they have dj's perform live while you eat and it's amazing!!Second, for how much you pay (happy hour prices) its very decent sushi/rolls. The portions are just like any other sushi place. Its not like WOW sushi cause I dont think such places exist in Austin, but it tastes good and will fill you up. The fish isn't smelly or anything like that. Overall pretty delicious food.I highly want to recommend their lychee cocktail, its delicious and come with actual lychees! I always get this drink, always! Sake bombs aren't bad either.Parking kinda sucks like you would expect downtown, but there is pay to park on the streets and garages around! If you get lucky on weekends they have decent parking hours!!The wait to be seated and served has never been bad for me, I've never had to wait to be seated here. However thats just my experience.I love the place, please try it!!!",4.0 star rating
"As a result of customer, service I can say without a doubt that this is the worst sushi establishment I've ever had the misfortune of stumbling across. Shit service with even shittier management. It's a joke. Nobody was accommodating. Literally will never be back and have absolutely stopped strangers on the side of the road and told them not to go in. Will absolutely tell people not to go. Will go out of my way to let them know that this place is not somewhere to go for food or a good time. As a server and service industry I am appalled and embarrassed that anywhere downtown would offer such revolting service to anyone. Please actually consider theses words before sitting down in this establishment.",1.0 star rating

"The food isnt great or bad. Its just alright, you'll never crave their food, nothing unique, just your usual tex mex served in a nicer setting. However on Sundays, they have their brunch special: $2 mimosas and bloody mary. That was nice, but make sure to ask for concentrated mimosas or extra orange juice because the mimosas were really watered down. I got a tortilla soup that came in a soup cup, so not very big AT ALL. That was $9, I'd say its a little overpriced. The place is definitely instaworthy though, really cute interior and furnishings. The outside is adorned with well cut wall vines and glass setting. There is patio seating so thats really nice too! If the prices were cheaper I think the restaurant would have more of merit.",3.0 star rating

"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and it was great. Had good traffic but there was no wait and few open tables. The ambience is pretty chill. Attire is casual, entree prices range from $12-$20, and the scenery is trendy. As far as service, it was good but not excellent. Took about 4 minutes for anyone to even greet us, and it was the bus boy who gave us water. Then another 3 minutes later our server greets us and asks if we would like any drinks or appetizers, we order a drink, and she walks away. After awhile, I have to stop a server waking by to order our food. The wait time on food that day was about the same wait you would for any other restaurant: about 11 minutes. After receiving our food, our server was a little more attentive to us.I ordered the Huevos Condesa, which was a good pick. It consisted of roasted chicken, fried eggs, poblano rajas, grilled onions, duck fat potatoes, bacon and Swiss chard with a side of three corn tortillas. With the michelada that I ordered, the two went well together. Overall, I would recommend this place for you Austinites or if you are traveling and want to try out a trendy Tex-Mex restaurant, you won't be disappointed.",4.0 star rating
"Atmosphere is cool, really neat space and really well designed.  Love that they've got multiple floors and that the bar is raised on a mezzanine sort of level. I give it 3 stars for these reasons 1 star for esthetics!1 star for drinks! 1 star for service! I subtracted 1 star for food and 1 star for menu presentation.The drinks were great, and seemed like everyone there knew it!  The bar was packed, my friends got to sit while I stood.  I didn't mind at all it was a great and upbeat area!The host staff and bar staff were great!  Our server was odd and super laid back but whatever that's fine!  Still keeping that star simply due to the other staff. The food got me, it was mediocre at best for the amount of $ I spend on my food.  Flavors we're balanced but there was just nothing truly exciting and Wowing about it. The menu was difficult to understand, I get it's a Mexican restaurant but for someone who doesn't speak Spanish it was a tough read, and to me didn't explain the dish well at all. I'd go back; but just for drinks and apps.",3.0 star rating
"Just finished eating there.  The flank steak was not awesome but it was quite rare, salty, and chewy.  The pork chops were only good.  Guacamole sampler was good.  Ceviche was good. Just don't bring your Starbucks drink in from around the corner.  Even if it's fresh and you haven't taken a single sip they will take it away from you if you want to stay and eat.  I should have deducted the $4 that got poured down the drain from the tip.",2.0 star rating
"La Condesa is alright for a quick meal and or happy hour, but living in CA I tend to be picky about my Mexican food. First and foremost, I understand that it is prime real estate being located downtown Austin, which comes with a high price tag for most dishes. With that said though the prices do not match the quality of the food I ordered. La Condesa from the outside is quite inviting and the fact that everytime I walk by it is crowded, which gave me high hopes for a good meal. Upon walking in I found myself waiting...and waiting even longer, until a server walked by after five minutes and said ""You can sit anywhere"". I should've listened to the myself and just found another restaurant nearby, but I was hungry and again the amount of people packed inside gave me high hopes. After finding a seat at their bar, I ordered a few dishes to share and a main dish. The chicken tacos I ordered were a tad bland, but did not really feel like complaining as I was quite hungry. Also got the roasted chicken with mole, which was pretty good, but again not worth the $23 dollar price tag honestly. Overall service was alright, but they were so slammed, I rarely was asked if I wanted another drink or needed anything extra at all.I guess maybe I am spoiled with ample amounts of wonderful Mexican restaurants where I live. Honestly though, I have experienced some good Mexican restaurants in different countries, so it's really not an excuse to use for the subpar food I experienced at La Condesa, but I would be up to trying it again to see if it has changed since the last visit.",2.0 star rating
The service and ambience of this restaurant was great! I got the mojito and steak tacos as well as the Mexican corn. GET THE MEXICAN CORN! It was to die for! The mojito was good too.

"Given how packed this chic restaurant was, and how Austin is known for Mexican food, this meal was disappointing.  We started with the guacamole tasting, expecting each guacamole to be significantly different in flavor.  However, the base for each one was exactly the same, just some garnish sprinkled on top.  Also wish the sample sizes were bigger - maybe cut down on the number and increase the sizes.  In most restaurants I've been to, taquitos often refers to fried rolls but here, they're tacos.  Two small tacos, with no sides.  Seemed pricey for what you get.  Out of the chicken, snapper, and pork shoulder tacos, the pork shoulder was definitely the best - oddly, you had to wrap this one yourself.  The naming conventions are confusing here.  3 stars is generous.",3.0 star rating
"The flavors at this restaurant are delicious and unique. The food tastes fresh with high end ingredients. I think they do a great job of combining different flavors in all of their dishes. I especially recommend the desserts. I'll be upfront in saying that if you're looking to fill your belly for a good price, this is not the right spot. But if you want a unique tasting experience in a beautiful downtown spot (and you're ready to spend some money), there is no place better. The service was amazing and our waitress really helped individualize all my food after I told her that I can't handle a lot of spice/heat. They did a great job of putting certain ingredients on the side for me. The food is delicious and I walked away feeling like I had a memorable dining experience. I recommend skipping the chips (because you can get those anywhere), and go straight for ordering a variety of small dishes and desserts to get the most variety in your experience.",5.0 star rating
"Pretty disappointing and mediocre overall. If you're in town for a short time, definitely skip this one. We regretted wasting a dinner here. The good: high-energy atmosphere, cool looking space, good guacamole tasting. The bad: lack of communication between multiple hosts, poor service, very weak margaritas, and ehh food that is overpriced. Our group had the chicken mole (barely eaten), pork belly, and taquitos and another forgettable item I can't recall. Menu is pretty limited. There are so many amazing restaurants in Austin, don't waste time at this place.",3.0 star rating
"La Condesa was everything I wanted it to be.  Nice ambiance, great drinks, food, and service.  We started with a Margarita, and the premium margarita with Pineapple.  No mixer here.  The flavors were of lime and agave.  SO GOOD.  We had an app of the Hamachi Ceviche (yellow tail ceviche, calamansi broth, avocado, crispy garlic, charred onion, habanero truffle oil.).  I could have had three more orders, and drank the marinade.  Best ceviche I've ever had next to what I got in Hawaii.  For our main courses I had the Arabicos Taquitos (seared venison, pickled cucumber, chipotle harissa, fennel pollen yogurt, cilantro on a bacon fat tortilla) ,  my wife had the El Califa Taquitos (NY Strip, cripsy manchego, cilantro, oak -grilled jalapeno-tomato salsa), and we had a side of street corn. Unbelievable.  Mine was the best in my opinion, but the strip tacito was amazing too.  It was like steak cheese toast on a tortilla.  We finished with a couple local beers.  The service was impeccable, the food was amazing.  Highly recommend this place!!!",5.0 star rating
"Numbero28 is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Austin.Everything about this place is authentic. It was a small Italian hole in the wall started by a man who had moved from Italy to Austin. Thick Italian accent and everything. Now it's grown to something much bigger.Their pizzas make my heart so happy. The Numbero28 Pizza is 100% the best pizza I have ever had, made with REAL ingredients and tastes exactly like an italian pizza should. In fact, all their pizzas are to die for. And every time I take a friend there, they agree with me.If you want amazing Italian pizza (or food in general, but the pizza is the best) with a nice cozy romantic indoor or outdoor atmosphere, this is THE place.",5.0 star rating
"EGGPLANT: A LOVE STORYI was tasked with taking someone out for her birthday who wanted nothing more than to eat caponata. After searching the menus of every Italian/Italianish restaurant in Austin, I found the Number28 was our best (read: only) option. We made the trek downtown on a cold night last week to celebrate.The place is small but in a cozy way. The space felt authentically Italian with small tables and not much fuss paid to decor. It appeared to have a full bar and outdoor seating, though we didn't partake in either of these offerings. There was a small wait for our table even though it was a weeknight, most likely due to the chilly, windy weather prohibiting diners from eating outside. The three of us snuggled around a table for two and ordered the caponata and calamari for starters. The caponata came with some grilled bread and was very nice. I love eggplant as does the birthday girl and we both really enjoyed it. The third person in our party is not a huge eggplant fan but even he conceded that it was tasty. The calamari was a different story. It wasted very fishy and was rubbery. The sauce that it was served with was over spiced. It tasted as if someone dumbed a bunch of paprika into it. We didn't finish it.We all liked our entrees, though they were not without faults. I order the penne all'amatriciana. I am not a big pasta person but I fell in love with this dish when I visited Rome a few years ago. Their version had a good flavor but was not authentically amatriciana in my opinion. Instead of (or maybe in addition to) guanciale, there was braised meat in the dish. It tasted good, but it was nothing like the dish I ate in Rome. The pasta was cooked inconsistently as well, as if the pasta and sauce had been mixed earlier in the night and then sat in a warmer until it was time to plate the food. There were bits that were dried/burnt, bits that were chewy, and bits that were cooked well. The birthday girl ordered the porchetta on my recommendation (I had previously tried it the only other time I ordered to go from Numero28). I didn't try it this time but she said it was  tasty along with the potatoes and cabbage that came with it. My husband ordered the pollo alla griglia and said it was great and very satisfying for something he considers a ""light"" option (he doesn't usually order chicken). I tried his potatoes and thought they were quite good. We had dessert waiting at home so we didn't order anything at the restaurant. Service was attentive and polite and most, if not all, of the people who worked there seemed to be Italian. I would give this place a lower rating if the caponata wasn't so good, since that's the entire reason we came here in the first place. I wouldn't recommend that anyone run out to try it, but it is a good option if you are in the neighborhood or if you need an eggplant fix.",3.0 star rating
"Stopped in for a bite to eat between work and a movie on a bustling Tues evening. As I solo diner, I sat at the bar...I'm glad I did because I could watch them cook. The cute Italian bartenders are at your service, with recommendations and quick service. There was still a little time left on happy hour, and they helpfully offered up the discounted specials, which were straight off the full menu.Lots of delicious options to choose from! If I had more time, I would've ordered the Eggplant Parmesan, which is apparently their specialty.Instead I went with the bartender's recommendation of wood fired pizza with arugula, prosciutto and Parmesan, which was absolutely perfect. Hot from the over, super thin chewy, yeasty, salty crust...and just a light dab of tomato sauce.I'd give the food 5 stars, except I only tried one item and can't provide a thorough review. Plus, the place is *tiny* and was packed! A testament to the good food, but a bit crowded and noisy, with adjacent tables and seats practically touching.",4.0 star rating
"We really wanted to like this place but it was just lacking in so many ways. First, the service. Extremely slow and inattentive. Second, the food was extremely bland and very small. When we ordered our meals we assumed Italian = oversized portion, pasta, etc. My eggplant parmigiana was just eggplant no pasta and the veal dish that was ordered by my friend was just veal no pasta either. Third, the price. Sorry but for $16 to just get a small portion no pasta, no side salad to start with or maybe some bread?  Nope, no bread either. The food was just ok and we all agreed we ate it not just because we paid for it but because we were so darn hungry. Our server was friendly when she came around but just couldn't make up for what our meal lacks.",1.0 star rating
"Finally, a truly authentic and casual Italian eatery downtown. Perfect for a bite before a show at the Moody or wherever your headed out. Great menu selection of items you won't see anywhere else in town (try the eggplant). Been twice and so far we've been very happy with our selections. And again, reasonable prices. Very similar to the Italian pizza restaurants you find all over the NY/NJ area. We've needed this in Austin. Highly recommend!",5.0 star rating
"If you haven't made it here, you should go! I went with a friend and somehow managed to completely miss the restaurant and just found the deli portion, but that was an awesome experience within itself. Because everything laid out is freshly made, they were also able to customize menu items according to your preferences. I ordered a gorgonzola pizza and the person behind the counter stopped me to make sure I knew what it was so that I would't have a bad experience. Needless to say the pizza was spectacular - but then I'm a sucker for anything wood and fire baked. My friend got the avocado egg toast. You can't really go wrong with that. Okay so dessert. The tiramisu was probably one of the best I've had in Austin. I recently made it to the actual restaurant portion and while nice and food is similarly great, I prefer the casual feel of the cafe for lunch. At both, for decor, taste, and presentation I was thoroughly impressed at how close they got the Italian ambiance down. Not too many places like this in Austin yet.",5.0 star rating

Standard Italian place in Austin. I got a margherita pizza which was pretty good. I'm giving this place three stars because the service was awful.

"We needed some where to get a meal and wine before a concert at ACL Moody Theater. Based on recommendations we decided this was a good bet for location and excellence. We were not disappointed. The service was welcoming and relaxed. We sat outside and ordered olives, bruschetta, carpaccio and wine. All were perfectly flavored and presented. The wine was enjoyed out of a carafe. You can order different sized carafes from their draft collection and also bottles are available. We ordered the Nero d Avola from their draft snd it was a good price and delicious. We also ordered the three cheese pizza and added basil. It comes out on a plank of wood freshly made in their ovens. We also ordered the lasagna bolognese. It was rich but not too saucy and heavy. Well Done!.",5.0 star rating

"I have a confession.  I have never been to Numero 28.  Ever. Thanks to the wonders of Uber Eats, I've never had to visit the actual restaurant. Isn't it a great time to be alive?Despite never being here, I would say that Numero 28's Capricciosa pizza is my favorite in town.  And it's not even 5 stars in my book.  Weird, right?  Well, it always arrives super soggy in the middle, but the overall flavors are so good, that I can live with it.  A lesser pizza could not overcome that flaw, but N-28's Capricciosa can.Something about the combination of the green olives, ham, mushrooms, and artichokes.  It's so good.  A word of caution though, I usually order the 12"" and one day, I thought I might like to have leftovers, so I got the 18"" and the soggy factor was even worse, and I don't think it was actually 18""--so an extra $9 for a pizza only slightly bigger than the 12"".  I think they measure by length and not diameter cause the 18"" was a long pizza rather than somewhat round. Also good, but often sold out, is the Carpaccio.  I am just amazed that it can be delivered from so far and still be so good.  Very thin cut, a lot of beef, excellent toppings. The salads are okay--sometimes spectacular, sometimes just okay, so I shy away from ordering unreliable things.  Everything else I have ordered from here tastes pretty generic.The tiramisu is really lackluster--but sometimes you just want something sweet, right?  It doesn't have enough mascarpone or enough liquid, so I usually have to put a splash of something on it to make it less dry.  So tasteless, I wonder if it is from Sysco...The Lasagna Bolognese and the Aracina are both very bland.  The pasta on the lasagna is often way overcooked and there's a lot of it and not much filling.  The Arancina is heavy on the rice and weak on the fillings as well and the flavors are totally muddled.  Given the wild variety of quality and flavors, N-28 is just a 3 in my book.  It would be too easy to order all the wrong things here and be very disappointed.  And I can't imagine taking the risk while eating there.  Being disappointed in your pjs at home is a lot easier to take than when in public.",3.0 star rating

"Beautiful outside space, really yummy food, and attentive, friendly staff. Can't ask for much better. I came here with a large group of coworkers and the staff was so accommodating and eager to please. We got several pizzas to share, which were fresh, cheesy and fire-baked. I liked the pepperoni (all of the meats, please) pizza more than the margherita, but both were fresh, loaded down with gooey mozzarella and flavorful tomato sauce. The meatballs were relatively small and came 6 to an order, but very tasty as well. I put them on the pizza because...why not? I could take or leave the bread that came with it, but as with most things: it was good dipped in the sauce.For ye vegetarians, the arugula salad was top-notch. Perfectly dressed, with delicious apples and nuts, I was a fan. Definitely a nice balance to the heavy, cheesy pizza. Will be back for sure.",4.0 star rating
"Delicious panini here - they bake the bread using their pizza oven. Considering how good the bread was, I have no doubt that the pizza would also be tasty here as well. I had the panino porchetta ($11), the classic Italian version of pork belly. The porchetta I've had before were usually roasted and seasoned with rosemary, among other Italian spices, but here, they were literally fried pork bellies - quite different from what I was expected, but still tasty, if not a bit heavy.I also ordered the arancina vegetariana - and comparing with other arancini, this one was one large ball that could fit an entire bowl (which is why this was plated instead). It was tasty and well-made, although personally I like my arancini without tomato sauce - but that's just me (Italians would scoff at me for this lol). This appetizer is big enough for sharing (and is priced for more than one person, at $10).Another table's lasagna looked well-prepared, with not so much tomato sauce, which is how I like it. I am tempted to come back for that, and to try other things in the menu.This place is undergoing expansion, to include greater offerings of antipasti, I believe. I'm glad this notable international chain made it out to Austin.Food: tasty, casual Italian comfort food (not Italian-American)Ambience: typical Italian cafe, laid-back, informalService: friendlyPrice: moderate",4.0 star rating
"My husband (native Italian) met the owner of this restaurant (also native Italian) on Facebook and he invited us to come eat at the restaurant. We ordered the vegetarian arrancino, the melanzana parmigiano, pizza, tiramisu, and cannolis. Everything was really good.

"A Perfect example of why Yelp is so great! We are in Austin for the F1 race and have had plenty of BBQ and Tex Mex so we want a little Italian. Bring up Yelp and  look for what's good and out pops Numero28!Had a couple of great appetizers; the arancina tradicional is a breaded saffron rice dish with Bolognese ragout that is divine and the Plopette a veal meatball dish with marinara and melted provolone which was nearly as good :-). The real stars were our mains! For our main dishes we ordered 2 - 18"" pizze, which seems huge when they arrived. One was a a spicy meat and red sauce version that we all loved and the second was a white sauce version of the Quattro formaggio. Both were excellent and for 5 people, including 4 beers and 2 glasses of wine ( it was happy hour) we got out with all that amazing food and drink for just over  $100 with a good tip. Service was wonderful with a team of servers attending. Including a delightful local girl who gave us the low down on the burgeoning 2nd street area. Would eat here every day if I could no joke.",5.0 star rating
"We randomly walked into Numero 28 last night for a late night dinner. The patio was awesome. The waiter was amazing and had a super thick Italian accent. I felt like we were eating pizza at a bistro in Italy. He was super helpful with picking out a meat/cheese board and wine to pair.  We ordered 2 pizzas to split between 4 of us which was the perfect amount.  The pizza was cooked  to perfection! I highly recommend the white pizza with the potatoes, I am still thinking about it.  We also ordered the 4 cheese and add sausage. The sausage was super flavorful and a nice touch.  I can't wait to go back and I wished they delivered!!",5.0 star rating
"Numero 28 had really good pizza, but everything else about the experience was absolutely terrible. We got there at 8:30pm, an hour and a half before closing, and felt rushed by the staff the entire time to get out. Music off at 9pm, last call at 9:30. Then the manager led the charge to freeze us out on a 40-degree night by leaving the patio door open the last 20 minutes we were there while standing at the door and staring us down. I have never actually written a bad review about somewhere, but we could not chug our decanter of wine fast enough to get out. Worst $80 ever spent, especially on a celebratory evening.

"I came here on a Monday night for dinner with two friends. The restaurant is located in Downtown Austin so we assumed it would be decent, we were sadly mistaken :(Our waitress was friendly, she seated us outside immediately despite not having made reservations. It was a little breezy and chilly that evening, we were seated near some heat lamps, but unfortunately it did not help much. We ordered Elotes (Mexican style street corn) as an appetizer to share among the three of us. It comes with four corn on the cobs, more like two actually since they were split in half and placed on a stick. The Elotes was good, I liked the cheese and chili powder sprinkled on top. At $6, it was reasonably priced. For my entree I ordered The Cochinita Pibil Taquitos which came with pork shoulder, black beans, pickled red onion, habanero escabeche and cabbage served with your choice of corn or flour tortilla. I was very disappointed in my meal. The pork had zero flavor, it was very dry and bland. The pickled red onion was overwhelmingly tangy and sour. The dish had way too many beans, which were overcooked and mushy. The only positive in this dish was the habanero escabeche, it was super spicy... eat with caution! I am glad I took a tiny bite before I ate an entire pepper :P At $12, it was not pricey for dinner, but it was not filling or tasty.This seems like a fun spot for happy hour, there is a cool bar area with seating upstairs. I would've enjoyed myself more if I had stuck to the Elotes and gotten a drink with it. I would not recommend this spot for dinner, nothing was really amazing and there are too many better options in Downtown Austin.",2.0 star rating

"Let me start of by saying this is a temporary rating as I plan on going back again and hopefully bumping it up. I went there for brunch with a few friends..really wanted the rhianna brunch but by the time I called for reservations they had a waitlist over a 100, CRAZY! Anyways, went on the following sunday and luckily found street parking not too far away. The service is great, water was never empty, the food wasn't a long wait and the waiters were always around if you needed anything, 5 star service. Being brunch and me loving mimosas, I opted for a carafe of mimosa (I was sharing too) while everyone else got a coffee. The carafes we were told are a full bottle of champagne? prosecco? and they were tasty and strong. When it came to food, I got the french toast while my friends got the crab/avocado toast, parfait, brisket omelette and a few other dishes I forget. French toast...sad to say I would give it 1 star, it was overly rich and dripping in butter. Because of the mimosas, I didn't understand why I couldn't get more than a couple bites in but I just assumed I wasn't hungry. It wasn't until I came home an hour later and dug into my french toast that I realized it was in a puddle of oil/buttery grese and my stomach wasn't feeling it. Also, there wasn't a french toast feel to it, seemed more like  a boston cream donut but but the dough was replaced with a buttery bread. My suggestion would be get one of the other dishes (if you get the parfait, order something else..it's hella tiny and our waiter even jokes about the size), and treat the french toast as a dessert to be shared. Overall, it's a great place for brunch and I will be going back but shall stick to the migas or the avocado toast. It's a little pricey but the ambiance, service and little things (the cream for coffee cam out in little metal milk cartons!!). And I forgot the most important thing...the mimosas were complimentay?!? so yea, totally coming back!",3.0 star rating
"I have been here before for a Beyonce inspired brunch and it was such an enjoyable experience that group of 3 friends and I decided to come back for a Rihanna inspired brunch. We weren't able to make a reservation online so we arrived at 10:30 when it opened hoping to get a table. The restaurant was by no means full then. We passed by tables with beautiful lighting and views into the courtyard-ish place outside but we were seated at a table inside a corner whose view was curtains. There were one or two more tables inside this dimly lit room. One was occupied by a big group of people for about the first ten minutes while we were there and we were alone thereafter. The dollar mimosas were suitable, as were the carafes. The server did not exhibit the best level of customer service. As we ordered our first carafe, we asked the server which flavors of mimosas they served, instead of telling us the flavors, or even juices, she responded with ""we don't have flavors, we use different juices"". We then had to ask which juices they had before she simply told us. Three of us ordered the creole benedict - which was delicious but more notes on that later. However, when one person in our party ordered a french toast for breakfast, the server condescendingly asked: ""that's it?"" After our food arrived, we noticed that one of the creole benedicts had no crawfish on it. When my friend told the server about it, we expected a good amount to make up for the omission but she brought 4 half pieces of crawfish. It honestly looked pretty pitiful. My creole benedict was tasting great, for a while, especially the hollandaise sauce and potatoes. At the end though, I lost my appetite because there was still cooking twine somewhere in my meal which I found as I was eating.As we wrapped up eating, we still had half of the latest carafe on the table. It was then when the server asked to bring us the check. We felt rushed because we were in the middle of the current carafe and had intended to order more. A few minutes later, the server came back with our checks and said, ""I know you guys are on your way out, but we have more reservations so could you please hurry."" We were confused as to why she was rushing us as we were in the middle of wrapping up and paying. We considered this impolite because there were several empty tables around us with seating from 4 - 8 people and in our experience, you shouldn't rush your customers out particularly if they haven't concluded their meal including the payment.  All in all, the food was good but the service was severely lacking which averages out to three stars.",3.0 star rating

The cheese plates, the bread plates, the everything was so tasty and the presentation was gorgeous. Mary, our waitress, was super friendly and very attentive without being pushy. For the life of me I can't remember the drink but it was jalapeño cucumber something and man was it good. Also could be used as a lip plumper! Okay, so I have another place to visit more regularly in Austin. Thanks Trace for the great experience and service.",5.0 star rating
"I expected something really new american and really tasty according to the menu prices! But unfortunately, i got happy with only a terrace and inside interior only! It is very stylish with a nice music and bar area.But food is too over priced, and not tasty.I ordered beef,which was just fine and nothing special for 32$. And a friend of mine ordered a burger for 20$!! Which was absolutely nothing special at all!!! For 20$?!? It was not even built at all, no tasty souses,everything was on a dish ""welcome to build your own burger"". I'm fine with it,but never for 20$! For 20$ burger i expected it to be much more special than what we got!Desert with "" pistachio"" on its name.agh,i didn't like it at all,the taste was horrible. I just didn't return it back to be nice and don't spoil the evening with a friend. Service is very nice and welcoming,but never the food! Over all bill was 100$ which is pretty crazy for a food we didn't enjoy. Will not recommend the place to any person who expect something really upscale dining out at such a pricy place.",2.0 star rating
"There was a group of 8 of us--I made a reservation on Opentable--the place was empty at 10 am on Saturday--I went because of the fabulous picture on Texas monthly of their fabulous French toast, and $1 mimosas--ok, so the French toast I think was frozen and deep fried, and ZERO whip cream on top although the picture was covered--they did have their $1 mimosas which were great--my gal pal had their pancakes and smallest pancakes I have ever seen--separate checks was easy, but didn't see our gal as much as we should have--if the place advertises a menu item with a huge picture to get people in, I highly suggest to make sure they match",3.0 star rating
"Was treated to lunch here one day by a vendor we work with. This restaurant is attached or right next to the W Hotel, so you know it's going to be fancy (but also probably good). We sat outside on the patio, which was particularly lovely on this October day. I had a little trouble ordering just because I was trying really hard to be good and not go back to our meeting in a food coma. I settled on the cobb salad, which was definitely one of the best cobb salads I've ever had. It had lovely chicken, avocado, and all the things you'd expect on a cobb salad. But the two ingredients that really put it over the top were the absolutely amazingly perfect little bits of thick-cut bacon (I picked every single one out of my salad) and the hard boiled eggs, which were just lightly pickled -- pink out the outside with some pickled flavor without being overly sour. So delicious. One of my lunchmates got the steak salad, which also looked pretty amazing. Service was fine. In all, a very nice lunch.",4.0 star rating
"My boyfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve dinner. They had a special menu 4 course meal for $115 per person. It was a great deal! Everything was beautifully presented and tasted amazing! There wasn't anything I didn't like about the food! My favorite was probably the lobster cakes :)Our waitress was also very sweet and attentive. She gave good recommendations for food. I tried things I wouldn't normally go for, because she sold it! The ambience was very classy/trendy, and the lighting gave it a romantic touch. I had a memorable experience here. I would gladly go back!",5.0 star rating

"Came here for Saturday brunch. Weather was awesome so we sat outside. Food was good but kind of small for the price. Our waitress was nice but hardly around. It was hard to order more drinks because of this. Either way, menu is good. They have a separate breakfast and brunch menu, because brunch starts at 10:30. But you can't beat the mimosa carafe at $5!! I got the brisket hash which was delicious but I was wanting more and felt it was a bit on the smaller side. I tried the special sangria, rose sangria and it was yummy to.",4.0 star rating
"Stopped by here on my way to Moody because they offer 20% off of food through a partnership with ACL Live. Wonderful!I ordered the bread and butter board which offered a vegan, vegetarian, and protein-based butter. I had beet/orange, ramp, and hummus as my spreads. Damn! The ramp was addictive and the hummus--phenomenal!I also ordered the crab cakes which were unforgettable. The aromatic spices in the butter were balanced perfectly with the jalapeño and cilantro pairing. The happy hour offerings are great but I didn't quite make it so I should be back soon!",5.0 star rating
This is my second time coming to Taverna and both times have been excellent. The first time we had dinner and I ordered a pasta dish with clams which was delicious and the dessert we got was a pistachio cake which was also tasty.This time we came for happy hour and we all got pizzas which were $7 for happy hour and very tasty. Also large portions for happy hour!The service both times was great and I have no complaints at all.,5.0 star rating
"Downtown shopping got my girlfriend and I super hungry so we looked up a few close restaurants that were in walking distance. We walked by Taverna and saw how packed it was and smelt how amazing the food was from outside. We walked in through the front and went to the hostess stand where we were greeted by the hostess and he said the only swearing available was he heated patio (not that heated). He did sit us right next to the heater but it did not make much of a difference.Moments later we were greeted by our waitress who presented us with the menu and we decided to get some mimosas to start our day after our eventful shopping experience. We both ordered a mimosa to drink. I ordered a Spaghetti Alle Vongole (it has claims in it) and my girlfriend ordered a California pizza. Photos were taken in the review.Our experience with the food and drinks.The mimosas took about 10-15 minutes to come out to us because they have been busy and they didn't have enough chutes so they gave us our mimosas in a regular glass.My thoughts on the Spaghetti alle vongole...the clams were alright, pretty small but tasted decent, the spaghetti was ok..as well the dish did not supply enough sauce and I wasn't too pleasant about that. I tried a piece of my friend's pizza and it was actually pretty delicious! I'd definitely get the pizza again but not the spaghetti alle vongole.Ps. Women restroom doors are broken. Accidentally walked in on someone when the door was supposedly locked. My door couldn't completely lock either I could push it out myself once I locked it.",3.0 star rating
I'm very dissatisfied with the food tonight and service.

"We were in Austin for the marathon and needed to carb load. Our favorite way to do that is with spaghetti. We ordered take out because we had a lot of prep work to do at hotel before the race. When we got our containers back to hotel, opening them was very disappointing. It was ugly and looked like a measly amount of food. It turned out ok, it was plenty of food, but I think they should reconsider how they package their take out. The picture I posted is how it looked when I opened the container. Keep in mind this was $18.50!!!",3.0 star rating
"This place is a solid fusion of Italian food and Austin atmosphere. I've had waits on food here due to crowds, some good bites, some afternoons just chilling and nibbling.  There is good variety on the menu and it's consistently solid and reasonably priced. A great stop if you're in the area around the W or Marriott (or city hall for that matter) and much easier on the budget wirh comparable food than many other Italian offerings downtown.",3.0 star rating
"I like the location of this restaurant. I have mainly ended up here out of convenience. The food is okay. We had a margarita pizza and eggplant parmesan. The pizza was okay. I did not care for the eggplant. I like the patio area. It was nice to sit outside and people watch. I recommend if you need somewhere to eat before an event in the vicinity, affordable, and fairly quick. I do agree with other reviews that the brunch is pretty good. I prefer the brunch menu to dinner.",3.0 star rating
"Me and my partner were in town and decided to try this place and it was fairly busy and excited. The menu looked nice and we got seated. But then it happened. We were IGNORED. I even looked at the hostess and another server. Ignored. Finally the waitress came and said:""hey I got you both waters if you need it"" it was awkward. But anyways we ordered food. It was good. Salad had really long stems that were awkward to eat. But in general the food is good. Service needs to be worked on. Will give it another try sometimes.

YAY!I've tried the eggs benedict and really enjoyed it, thought it was above average for sure. Usually I stick to the Eggs Any Style though and it never disappoints!Otherwise, I have only been once at regular lunch hours and ordered a pizza.

"I've only been here for brunch on the weekend, so I can only speak for breakfasty food here.  But as far as the standard two egg, protein, and potato plate goes, Taverna makes a solid rendition.  The sausages are link style, which I prefer over patties, and are thicker than most other places' links.  They're well seasoned, not overly salted, and tender throughout.  The hash brown potatoes were similarly delicious but greasy enough that I left some on my plate.  If I wasn't on a health kick right now I would have taken them down though.As for the restaurant itself, I liked how roomy and open the main dining area felt.  There was a decent sized bar to the right and an outdoor dining area under a covered patio at the entrance.  Overall a really cool space.",4.0 star rating

We would have liked to see a few more straight forward pasta options -- how about cheese ravioli or manicotti at an Italian restaurant, y'all?A few in our party wondered why the plain pizza lovers got Margarita pizzas covered with dark greens like they were an extra topping? The chef's desire for presentation should be outweighed by customer preference. Nice place. We would happily go back.",4.0 star rating
"I'm only giving one star b/c I can't give zero. Terrible service and food. Not professional whatsoever. Yesterday, I had the displeasure of eating lunch with my husband at Taverna at Downtown Austin.He ordered the Gnocchi Rustici with short rib ragù. I didn't realize that meant it came with plastic baked in. YES--PLASTIC. My husband gagged, as he began to PULL PLASTIC FROM HIS THROAT. Of course, prepping the food isn't on the waiter per say, but the restaurant does have an obligation to work as a team and take care of each others mistakes. But when we told the waiter the situation he dismissed the situations just saying ""sorry about that"". He just quietly took the plate off the bill, acting like nothing had happened. He didn't even ask if my husband was okay...Overpriced pasta with a side of plastic for 16 bucks???? Not only does that sound like a rip off, it sounds like a death sentence.It sickens me to think about  how much PLASTIC he probably had already eaten. Please, dont eat here. What a waste of time, money and a slap in the face of disrespect. There's so many other wonderful restaurants in Austin to explore, don't spend your money here.",1.0 star rating

"My friend and I dropped by for dinner at this place after an event at the Moody theatre. It was a quick,  convenient walk across the street.  Nice restaurant, good service and food.  They make their own pastas so that's a plus since very few restaurants put forth the effort.  The location is great and the food has potential but falls a little short.  We ordered the calamari, gnocchi and spaghetti cabonara.  It's good enough but a little bland, nothing really special especially for that price, so I wouldn't make the effort to return.",3.0 star rating
"Lived in downtown Austin for 18 years and decided to try this place out. It was not a good experience. 1. Got seated and ordered coffee and OJ, didn't bring sugar, stirring spoon, or creamer. 2. They then just forgot us in corner why others who arrived later ordered. 3. We finally got up and complained. They did not give a shit. No sorry, nothing. 4. Floors were so slick I am surprised no one has been injured. 5. We left, won't be going back. Would have been 0 stars, but not an option.",1.0 star rating

What's worth getting: lots of their rolls and the takoyaki. Let me emphasize the takoyaki. It's sooo good! Also, if you're going in a group like I did, be sure to order Lychee Sake. The lychee flavor is so tastey, you won't notice the alcohol flavor.Be prepared to eat your heart out here.",5.0 star rating
Came here after ACL tonight around 9:45. We beat the crowd so there was no line. Our waiter was awesome! Our food came out fast. Almost everything we ordered came from the HH menu. We ordered the Mussel Hot Pot (w the creamy sake sauce) off their regular menu and it was so delicious! Our waiter suggested that we order some toast with the hot pot and it was the way to go. We soaked our toast in the hot pot soup and it was to die for! Highly recommend!,5.0 star rating
"Clearly I am not the only one who doesn't enjoy this place. Didn't chose coming here- twice in one day- wouldn't ever go back. I'm not sure you can all what they serve sushi. Nothing was fresh.None of the items I ordered came close to tasting like the real thing. Agedashi tofu- super sweet and came out at almost room temperature. So confused. They had a special roll: Lobster with truffle oil. I'm not sure what I was eating, but neither lobster nor truffle oil were present. Salmon Skin hand roll- meh nothing to write about. Very fishy. Sashimi Tako- quite rubbery and well if you like octopus- fresh is the only way to go. Felt like I was chewing on a wad of old double bubble gum. I'm not sure what they use for wasabi- but it wasn't what I am accustomed to. It was like green flavorless play- doh. I do believe their only saving grace is they are downtown. If you're intoxicated enough- everything taste good. Oh yea- let me not forgot the shard of glass I found in the bottom of my pint- good thing I didn't throw back that last swallow. One free beer for me. Yea...**did I mention we were the only 2 ppl in the entire place. Maybe they served us yesterday's left overs**",1.0 star rating
"Reverse happy hour starts at 10pm Mon-Sat and spans all day Sunday. SUCH a great place to pregame before your night out (on Sixth Street/Rainey). This was my friends and I's go-to pregame spot through all of college given that it's walking distance to a lot of bars. If you're trying to make reverse happy hour on weekends, be sure to get there around 10pm to ensure seating (they don't take reservation). Service can be slow during this time, but the prices can't be beat, and the food is actually good.It's the perfect place for a pregame because there's: fairly cheap food (great agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, sushi, fried rice), fairly cheap drinks, dim lighting and a DJ that plays chill but upbeat music. While this is a great pregame place, it's also not that rowdy. Highly recommend!",4.0 star rating
"Great HH but the staff could use some work in regards to customer service. Slow, not terribly sincere from the partially enthusiastic host that seemed more excited & friendly once her friend arrived at the bar... encouraged me to sit at the bar vs inside, when they weren't busy so felt compelled after a long day...Bartender was friendly enough but throughout seemed more engaged with a co-worker & ladies... (cursing & speaking rather unappetizing as far as conversation & loudly so) forgot some items, so just bounced out mentally to drown out the 'ambiance'. HH & fine for the price but won't sit at the bar again or perhaps just get takeout sushi elsewhere.  One less * bc the communal restrooms not only reek of urine, are usually out of order & I feel I'm at a dive bar on 6th St. Vs a sushi establishment in the nicer whse district... Worth the price, if you can stomach the 45% presence of engaging service, bathrooms & crowd.",2.0 star rating

"This is literally my favorite sushi restaurant in the city. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. They also have a bar area. The indoor seating hosts a great vibe with a dark interior and some colorful lights. Music is usually at a perfect volume where you can jam out but also hear everyone sitting at your table. Reverse happy hour gets super packed and they won't take reservations during this time. Their happy hour menu is probably the best out of the many sushi places in the area. They have both sushi, Maki rolls, appetizers and drinks on their happy hourWhat I recommend on happy hour:-Popcorn chicken app : SUPER WEIRD to say this is honestly the best popcorn chicken I've ever had-ceviche tostadas app: comes with four and they are amazing. Make sure not to drop the toppings because it is PILED HIGH !-Agadashi Tofu app: it comes with a sweet sauce and some crispy toppings. Honestly the best un-pressed tofu I've had ever. -Pineapple sake: I'm not usually a sake fan but this is sweet and delicious without being sugary/syrup-y tasting. Pair it with an Asian beer and have a ball making sake bombs. Just ask for the sake bomb cups! Good for taking them as a sake bomb or just sipping. -strawberry orange martini : for the martini loving ladies-all the sushi because it's fantastic. I usually go for the shaggy dog or one of the dragon rolls. The volcano roll is also a favorite among my friends! It's even piled up to look like a mountain/volcano.",5.0 star rating

"Literally life threatening experience here.We arrived well ahead of our party to ensure that we communicated clearly to our server (""F. Huey"" according to the receipt) that my wife had a SEVERE shellfish allergy. The server assured us that she would communicate to the staff and that accommodating her needs would not be a problem. We both ordered bento dinners that had to be modified for safety. Again, the server assured us that those changes (basically every side was changed to tempura veggies) was no problem at all.Meals come out, and what is the first thing she bites into? A giant shrimp. Given that everything was breaded and fried, there is no way she could have known that she had just been served a plate-full of death. Naturally she ran to the bathroom to purge, wash her mouth out and take some Benedryl. I called the server over to inform her of the situation and what did she do? Apologize for the mistake by blaming the cooks and assuring us that she had put the allergy on the ticket. She took the plate, scrapped off the veggies, and returned the steak. Fortunately for everyone, my wife did not go into anaphylactic shock and no hospital visit was necessary, but she had swollen lips and blisters on the roof of her mouth for several days after the dinner.Apart from the jeopardized safety of the situation, a huge concern was the indifference of management and staff to the situation. No visit from management during the 2 hour meal, no follow-up visits from the server besides filling of waters... nothing. They did compensate my wife's meal, but that is pittance compared to what she went through and all future plans for the evening had to be cancelled so she could get home to more medication.Terrible dinner, terrible service, would not recommend to anyone.",1.0 star rating
"Reverse happy hour is where it's at. Reasonably priced sushi and appetizers combined with sake in a prime location downtown will make your night. Combine that with a live DJ and you have a pretty bangin' place to start your night off right. Parking is sparse and will most likely require you to park in the garage next door for a fee, but if you have a big enough group of people coming, then it's not as big of an issue.One thing I didn't like was that their happy hour rolls selection seemed kinda bare and included a lot of rolls that were fried/cream cheese-y which is on the opposite spectrum of my type of sushi.",4.0 star rating

"After walking around downtown my wife and I saw this location and figured we would stop for an aperitif and some wine of course!  In this review I want to start off by saying this is a decent wine option for the casual wine drinker, but as someone who is in the industry I tried to not be overly critical.     The wine list gets a C grade in my industry opinion, and a B- for those who are casual wine drinkers.  Thus instead of a three star review I am giving them four stars.  Their pricing is not awful, but one should try to come on Sundays when bottles are 33% off to help offset the markup that restaurants constantly give.  The outdoor seating area is what brought us in as well since it was a beautiful day, and their patio is quite nice.     We ordered a fig and prosciutto pizza to go along with a medium off dry resiling.  The pizza came out in a timely fashion, and the wine was decent.  The mix of the two was actually very nice, but I would estimate that most this staff is fairly beginner level with wine knowledge.  I would have anticipated some more interaction with the waitress, but perhaps most customers know what they are looking for so I will give her a pass.  Overall our experience was good and if possible I would have given it all 3 1/2 stars, however I am going to be generous here and give them 4 due to the food quality for money spent.",4.0 star rating

"The brunch food was very mediocre for the price, and that's coming from San Francisco, the land of overrated overpriced and hyped lazy brunch culture. I came with a large group for an event and the brunch seemed disorganized as if they had not anticipated the group. It took an hour and a half to get served the entree which cut it close for some people heading to the airport. The service was pleasant enough and got our orders correct but slow. They served french press coffee by request, was odd for brunch as I'd expect it'd be a given. Carafes of mimosas and plates of fruit, and small cut up muffins and bread were made available to hold us over which was very nice. They had a 3 course menu brunch with 1-3 options for each, the portions are small and very manageable.Caprese Salad - Decent and flavorful basil pesto but nothing special and a small portionSteak and Eggs - The filet mignon was pretty good, very tender and properly medium rare. The eggs were way overcookedCreme Brulee - Not even mediocre, little caramelization or deep flavor and grainy texture. As if it were frozen and then hastily torchedI was satiated but not stuffed, though thought the portion size could be more generous. The service was nice but really slow. Peeking into the back, it appeared as if there was only one cook making everything to order without having prepped the work. The food was mediocre to okay, not quite living up to what you'd expect for the price and self-presentation.",2.0 star rating
I love everything about the food and atmosphere of this restaurant. But the service is very spotty. My most recent experience was that I had to seat myself. Our server Grace brought our food out separately and before we got our drinks. After she delivered the food she went and sat in the back area and chatted with another server. She never checked back with us or delivered our wine flights. I actually went and got the wine flights myself. The bartender was helpful and cleared plates and asked Grace to bring us our check. She handed us the check and said sorry. It was a very insincere and made me feel like we were inconveniencing her from her conversation with her coworker. I love this restaurant but the trend of bad service is beginning  to make it not worth it to visit this restaurant.,3.0 star rating

"This is a cute wine bar right in the middle of 2nd Street so it was nice to sit outside and see people walk down the street. Getting the Carafe for $10 and splitting it was the smartest thing!

"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews! Came here on a bachelorette weekend. All of the food we had was amazing and our server was very nice. He even built us customized wine flights (I had pinot grigio and riesling cause those are my faves) and was very accommodating. For the food, we all purchased a bunch of appetizers, a few purchased entrees. The mussels were my favorite, followed by the scallops (can you tell I love my seafood?). I wasn't a huge fan of the potstickers, and generally, I love dumplings from almost every single culture (dumplings/eggrolls/pot stickers/empanadas/samosas are BAE)! I know Cru is a chain, but I don't mind them. I'll be back.",4.0 star rating
"I went here with a group of girlfriends after we had brunch and the service was HORRIBLE.First off, we walk in and they only had one guy helping with 8 ladies order and then he waited til he poured each of them until he brought them over so it took us about 25 minutes to get our samples. What was odd is that I saw two people in the back of the restaurant, who worked there, just hanging out and they didn't want to help out with the server. It was just really odd because you would think he would want to help out one of his coworkers.We asked for our bills to be separate and you would've thought we asked for something that was so much more severe. I think that everyone could get much better of an experience if you go anywhere else.",2.0 star rating
"Such a classy ambiance for a wine night. I went with my roommates to celebrate a job offer and it was perfect. I went on a tuesday night around 9pm so it was extremely lively and empty. It's rustic feel with a obscure kitchen area in the back and a big wall of wine selections. Im a beginner wine drinker so I didn't quite know what was what but the waiter was very friendly in making recommendations. There's a option for ""flight"" which gives you 2ounces of 3 different wines. I took the flight option for ""rosé all day"" which let me taste 3 different rosé wines. It was 14$ for the flight option. The rosé were a little too bitter and dry for my taste cause i prefer bubblies. My roomies got the bubbly wines and they loved it. They have 4 different cheese platters that are good complements for a wine night, we got one called ""sinful pleasures"" something like that and it was really good, especially the chunk of honey comb that comes with it. Overall I think prices are really decent for the atmosphere and quality of dining you get. I really recommend it for wine nights with the girls or just a date night place.",5.0 star rating
"sad that som many people have not had great experiences here, while i do agree with some of them slightly, that the services is in some need of help, the food and wine selection made up for it in my opinion, i also was not on any time constraint and was there to simply get drunk with some girlfriends so i think if i was on a date or actually planning on a quick dinner it would not suffice. We ordered a fig salad and mushroom pizza, both amazing!!! i could eat the mushroom pizza everyday, and it was huge! we all got flights of white wine, and then some. the creme brule was also amazing. this place is much more expensive than two $$ tho, a flight of wine, half the pizza and half the salad was $50.....treat yourself if youre going herealso indoor and outdoor seating",4.0 star rating
"Came here around 9 on a Saturday night. The place wasn't busy. Got s flight of wines, bartender was nice. The wines were good but the reason for the low stars are the markups. What they have as a $60 bottle of sauv bland goes for $11. And while the wines in the flight were pretty different and allowed me to really check a few of them out, they were low-point wines (88-91), not super high quality I would expect from a wine bar.",3.0 star rating
"Wow. Honestly walked in with zero expectations, but boy was that food TERRIBLE. We had the caesar salad which reeked of too much anchovy! YUCK! Inedible.

We were not disturbing anyone! Or causing any kind of problems. They were super polite to my boyfriend, he was the only white guy on the group, so we felt disrespected because of our race.

"This restaurant is in a great location, both in terms of being downtown and in terms of the beautiful outdoor seating and overall decor they have especially in terms of the weather. As a result, the prices will match this (no free chips/salsa here).The drink selection was good but the two drinks we had were pretty bland. We had a margarita and a pisco sour, and while both were pretty mediocre, the latter was nothing like a pisco drink should be, and at first iv wasn't even sure which drink was which.That being said, their 4 salsa set is more of what I'd call ""craft salsa"", and being served in small bits and without a lot of texture or flavor, but pretty colors. We also ordered the pork, and while it was pretty tasty as was the mashed potatoes, both were a bit too salty and the pork itself was very much RARE in at least 25% of the meat. Mind you, I LOVE medium-rare meat, but for PORK this is not ok.All in all, not a fan.",2.0 star rating
"If you want to try this place out because thrillist recommended it, I would wait for the hype to end.... happy hour was great, drinks are half off. However, seating is EXTREMELY LIMITED! If you don't mind hovering around someone else's table by all means, check this place out. The drinks were decent but I had to ask the bartender to make my spicy Paloma actually spicy lol. So if you do brace the crowd definitely ask to add habanero bitters to your drink if you like it spicy. We didn't order food but it looked delicious and again, during happy hour it is a great price!",4.0 star rating
"I just can't with this place... I've been here three times now, and I've tried to make myself like it because it's a trendy interior Mexican restaurant on the 2nd street restaurant district, but it is just not that great. This place is expensive. I know most people who come here probably understand this, but it is not just the 15-25 dollar entrees that are offensive, but the fact that they are absolutely tiny. They are not bad, but they don't blow my mind, flavor-wise. For instance, the last time I was here a few days ago, I had the chile relleno. The flavor was good, but the texture was quite soggy, no real crisp, not very interesting. Not what I expect when I pay $20 for a plate.Also, their guac (we got the classic) is fine. I make better quac at home, and it costs under a dollar to make and less than 5 minutes to assemble, so unless their avocados are some super-rare-unicorn avocados, I don't know how they can justify the $12 price tag.My husband's drink was weak, and the beer selection is kind-of unimpressive for Austin. I have been here during happy hour, and that was the only time I actually enjoyed it. With significantly cheaper drinks and a few Mexican street corns, happy hour is worth the trip. But they only do it in the bar and you have to get there early to get a seat, because the bar area is tiny. One final note. Every time I've been in the main dining area in the evening, I see a table of older people reading their menus with their phone flashlights. If people can't read their menus, that's not ambiance, that's just stupid.",2.0 star rating
"Mediocre food. The guac has preservatives which is always a let down. Whats wrong with fresh avocados and ingredients made to order???

"There's something about this place- I just like being here. The dining room is open and colorful with towering fiddle leaf fig trees and views of downtown. Service is always perfect. I'd recommend showing up early and getting a half-off mezcal margarita or three. They make them like I would make them at home- strong, and with fresh lime juice. For food I love the crab guacamole with green apples, the Hamachi ceviche with shaved yellowtail and calamansi broth, and the carrot salad- crispy local carrots with cardamom yogurt, currants, and so on. Get the El Califa- steak tacos with fried cheese. Also, did you know turnips are the new Brussels sprout? So try those too, they're local and yum.",5.0 star rating
"The atmosphere was nice.  I like the high ceilings, art work, and feel of the place.  The food was not very good with the exception of the queso and mini corn tortillas.   The red fish was fishy, and the mole was average.  Portions were small, and food was slow to come out.  Service was slow, as well.  And all at a pretty penny.",3.0 star rating
"In a town that is replete with Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurants, this one simply does not rise to the top tier. The service, including the front door staff, busser, and server, were all polite and efficient. However, nothing that stood out from any other average or better restaurant. The margaritas were tasty, as I expected. That said, it was not a very generous size drink after adding the ice and the garnish. Maybe $12 each is a bit high. (Or maybe the have a HH special at some point?). My real challenge was the food itself. The guacamole appetizer was uninspired. Fresh, yes; unfortunately the texture and flavor were lacking something to set them apart. My chicken torta (milanesa de pollo) was very difficult to eat. The bread was extremely chewy. I could not cut it with the knife and when I tried to bite it, it tore awkwardly and spilled ingredients all over the table. The chicken breast was fine. The spicy red pepper spread was actually a bit too spicy for an item on the sandwich menu (and I like spice, in general). So, would I go again? Not sure I see any reason to do so. There are a dozen other better places within a mile, even some of the food trucks. Great location, so this is a sadly missed opportunity to be something special.",3.0 star rating
"Was not impressed by the vegetarian menu. Priced wayyyy too high for the value. Should try adding free chips and salsa to the menu to perhaps give you an edge. Wouldn't recommend or try again.

"I made the reservation on their site. Since the drop down only allowed for 5 guests I wrote in the comment section that there would be 6 people for dinner. When we got to the restaurant, not only were they not ready for a table of 6 but the host proceeded to give me a lecture on how I was lucky that this time they were able to accommodate me and that next time I should be calling them the day of to make sure it's okay. When asked if they received the notes attached to the reservation he said yes but the other host must not have seen it. As for the food, it was sub par and not worth the price. If you order a $12-16 botana dish just be prepared to only receive 1 very small item that is not enough to share. The $16 El Califa tacos that we ordered looked like they had been sitting under the light for too long because the meat looked grey and the cheese was past crispy and overall just hard to eat. Not going back and definitely wouldn't suggest.",2.0 star rating

"Came alone for a late dinner and sat at the bar. The bartender was busy but provided me very good service. The menu of tequilas and mescals is extensive but I opted for a local beer. To see the menu I had to use my flashlight app on my cell phone. Now I am good with ambience but it was dark enough to sleep. I order the chili rellenos. The flavor was very good. The stuffed pepper came with micro greens on top that had a good earthy flavor and pumpkins seeds for texture. With that said, the portion size was pretty small for the price and came with no sides.My food was good. If you are craving upscale Mexican and have money to spend, I'd say give it a try. If your really hungry and you just want some authentic Mexican, there are other options that you may prefer.",4.0 star rating
"The staff here are great! I had a great friendly service. The locations is good and the restaurant looks really nice inside! For me the food is the most important. I paid $50 +tip for the worst tacos and guacamole I have ever had. Just four tacos guacamole and an horchata. I don't leave reviews here often but I really want people to avoid this place. I get the price I know rent isn't cheap downtown and you have to charge but man I don't know if the cooks had a bad day but I had the Califa taco and a chicken taco and the tortilla was cold and dry and nothing special on the ingredients at all it was just bad. Honestly I know dozens of taco stands that serve better tacos than this. The guacamole was just basic. It's not bad but I expect better they seem to take a lot of pride in the guacamole they even had a ""sampler guacamole"" option for $18.It's just bad over all. I was starving and didn't even finish my food. Props to the staff for great service but y'all need new menus or new cooks I don't know it was just bad. I'm not a fan or torchys tacos but I would prefer torchys over this. As a matter a fact I don't even cook and I bet any amount of money I can make better tacos. The horchata was really good so I'll give two stars for that.",2.0 star rating

"Tried Umi for the first time tonight and the food was lackluster and sub par to say the very least. We ordered spicy edamame and vegetable tempura as an appetizer, both were just OK. The truly disappointing part of the experience though, were the entrees. I ordered udon noodles with tofu with the mushrooms on the side. My boyfriend ordered the seafood soup. When my noodles arrived, there were no more than 4 visible vegetables in the entire dish. The sauce was slimy and bland. The carrots were bagged, shredded carrots, and though I have never described it this way before, I would call the bok choy a disgrace. It was soggy and limp and hardly even warm, which was odd as the rest of the dish was warm. Don't know how they managed that. When I went to eat one of the mushrooms, it was stone cold. It tasted like biting into a soggy sponge. The entire dish was the color of Campbell's chicken noodle soup, before you cook it. The tofu was also strange. The coating on it tasted like fried food that has turned soggy. Not crispy like you'd expect. Just a gigantic disappointment.My boyfriend says his soup was spicy and salty. In the description, it came with a quail egg on top- which you'd assume would be poached and runny, instead it was a tiny hard boiled nightmare. The seafood in it was ""tasteless garbage"". The single most shining part of the meal was the friendly service. Our waiter was attentive and quick. That being said, the quality was so not worth the prices, and we won't be returning.",1.0 star rating

"I love UMI, they have a great reverse happy hour. My husband and I used to come every Friday night for our date night. We cut back on our weekly outing to UMI but we still pop in every now and then too.We usually sit at the bar when we go. Bar staff is always great and service is consistent! I even took some friends there one time for a dinner party and was quite pleased. The waiter gave our table saki to apologize for the extended wait time. Funny thing, I don't think any of us noticed but it was definitely an appreciated gesture!We started venturing of the happy hour menu since we go there so often. I absolute love the Firecracker roll though, definitely a must try. Gyoza is always good. I also always have a miso. Their miso broth is good and also have tofu and seaweed. I hate going to restaurants where it's just broth so this is great to me when I go there.Longhorn roll is also really good. This is on their happy hour menu. Spicy tuna tacos are good. I could go on...My husband and I are from California, so we are a little bit of sushi snobs but this place has gotten our money plenty of times. They fly their fish in from Alaska every 3 days I believe and their are reasonable priced. Can't go wrong for a good happy hour!",4.0 star rating

I have also tried the gyoza (typical gyoza) and the Haru Maki (which is basically an eggroll - you get quite a few but they are nothing to write home about). Lately, they have been getting my orders wrong which docked them two stars and has caused me not to go as often. Hopefully their service picks back up!",3.0 star rating
"I came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and the restaurant was relatively empty, so seating wasn't a problem. The host and the server we're both incredibly friendly and extremely professional. The restaurant itself has great ambience. One side has a large, well-stocked bar with plenty of seating. And the other side seems primarily for a restaurant use.I ordered the lunch Bento box with chicken teriyaki and I also ordered a spicy tuna roll. The chicken was great, the California roll was great, but the edamame looked freezer burnt and the three pieces I tried were all very chewy instead of crispy and fresh. The rice was rice, nothing too exciting there. The dumplings were actually my favorite part! The spicy tuna rolls had a little bit more chili than what I gotten used to, so if you like spicy, it's a great option. It's expensive though, I think I paid seven dollars for a spicy tuna roll. That's something you normally pay about five dollars for, or it's on a lunch special somewhere right next to the California roll.The salad that came with it was absolutely drenched in about an entire cup of ginger dressing. It was about five pieces of lettuce and then a massive amount of dressing that essentially created a salad soup, it was inedible (see pics). Overall, I like the place. Great ambience, the staff was on their game, it's just the food that leaves something to be desired. Nothing besides the soup salad, was absolutely horrible. But nothing was really that great either.

"I am somewhat of a sushi snob, but sadly, of late, my paycheck doesn't match my palate, so I am always on the prowl for quality to sushi at a budget price, which led me to discover this hidden deep south-side gem!My brother and his girlfriend took me here one Sunday evening as we were all starving and since I live in the Arboretum, it was going to be at least a 30-40min trek back up MoPac, so they took me to their weekly go to, Umi! It is located in an unassuming strip mall, but once you go inside, it is surprisingly nice and chic! The best part is, when we walked in around 9pm the DJ was already making the place thump with some amazing house music usually found on W 4th St!The place is clean, especially the restrooms, which I always think is a good gauge of most restaurants' quality standards. The staff seems a little stand-offish at first, but I think that is more a cultural issue rather than a caliber of service one.The price-point here is a little elevated if you come for a standard dinner, but if you take advantage of the reverse happy-hour (9:30pm-Close) you can definitely get more bang for your buck! We started off with sake bombs, $6.95, which gets you a pint of beer and a full carafe of sake!Next, we had the 3 standards that my brother and his GF usually get: The Shaggy Dog, The Spicy Roll, and The Longhorn. These are off the specialty roll list on the HH menu, but you can save a solid $2/roll! We tried the Tiger Eye Roll just to experiment, but sadly, this was the only roll that really didn't do anything for me. The Shaggy Dog and Spicy Rolls were good and filling, but the The Longhorn stole the show! Everything happening with this roll and in my mouth was fantastic perfection! Honestly, when I make my way back down here, I will be treating my champagne taste to a sake bomb and Longhorn Roll budget meal!SAKE SAKE SAKE! BOMB BOMB BOMB!",3.0 star rating
"I was there when I was on my way to Corpus Christi from Dallas. It was just very crowded everywhere in Austin, and I didn't have much choice. In any case, we chose this restaurant for our lunch.The restaurant was very decorated. We were greeted at the front door. To our surprise, we were the only party in the restaurant. Well, too late to go anywhere else. Looking at the menu, the door were pretty pricey. We were thinking that that's probably typical for Japanese cuisine. We then ordered 2 rolls - back in Plano, Allen, McKinney, places like Densetsu, Shiwase, Wasabi had pretty large portions, so we held on to our ordering.Finally, our food arrived, we were a little surprised by how small the portions they were. The taste were actually not bad, but not as good as those mentioned above. But, it is considered very pricey as compared to them! Checked out the pictures I uploaded.It was just an OK experience.

"Went before a concert at The Moody Theater/ ACL. Not only is it right next to the Moody Theater, it is a nice blend of inside / outside seating. We sat inside on one of the cool moon shaped high back bench/chairs.  Service was good. I was impressed that the server noticed we ordered only one entree and split it into two plates. Nice touch!The ambience for two people was excellent.The food was good - it felt like it was more about presentation than quantity (not necessarily a bad thing). Hangar Steak, Tiger Bread and the Tomato ""salad"".  It was  an enjoyable evening and would come back again.",4.0 star rating
"We had the Shaved Brussel Sprout Salad, Chestnut Soup, and Coconut Crab Cakes for starters and all were very good. It is too bad the rest of the meal was not up to that level. My fiancee had the Roasted Niman Lamb Tomahawk. It had too much fat on it, and it was very grisley/hard to chew, and didn't finish his meal . I had the Peperoni Bolognese and loved the sauce but my pasta was undercooked. The ambiance and service were excellent, but the food fell significantly short of expectations for this location and price point.",2.0 star rating

"Hell Night 2016 was one of the most creative and exciting menus I've ever eaten. Everything from the drinks, to the appetizers, to the main courses, to the deserts, had heat levels attached to them. The range of heat was 1 to 5. One being mildly hot. Five being flames shooting out of your mouth!!!Before I go any further I need to mention our server Ashley, she was absolutely excellent! She was encouraging of our choices and expressed her amazement that my young dining partner ordered the hottest hell night entree! Our water was refilled constantly they had another staff member making the rounds constantly. Ashley gave suggestions on ""must try's"".Trace has a beautiful atmosphere, they normally are not open after brunch on Sunday's. Lots of staff there, Managers making the rounds frequently, timing of food perfect, Chefs came out of the kitchen and spoke with several diners asking how everything tastes and how enjoyable the heat levels in the food were.This event was to benefit the Sustainable Food Center. All in all very entertaining, fun, delicious and for a good cause!",5.0 star rating

"FAB meal, FAB service! Quantities biggest drawback.Austin was our server. Drinks arrived in appropriate time, including our wine sample before bottle purchase. Austin understood we would be sharing at our table, so extra plates were brought and placement for as many people to access was attempted. Ordered from the special Formula 1 menu and didn't have a single thing I wouldn't order again. Sides: braised kale, grilled asparagus, mustard greens prepared with ginger and soy, and white cheddar grits w/sausage. (We were treated to an extra serving of these when the manager came by to inquire on us, and our Auntie asked for more - it was, after all, part of her 70th bday fest.)Started with fried oysters, which were 4 oysters for $12, and in my opinion, not outstanding. Cousin had a squash/pumpkin ""salad"" that came out on a very large black plate and looked more like a work of art than an appetizer. Sister had the crab cakes which she pronounced ""awesome.""Everyone ordered something different and there wasn't a plate left with food on it except mine. I had the red wine braised quail w/gnocchi and was acutely disappointed that the gnocchi tasted (and had the texture of) mashed potatoes. Still, four stars because I did not leave hungry at all and would return.ALL of the staff checked in on us, and helped with the ever onus pics. Kudos, Trace!",4.0 star rating
We had a big bachelorette party dinner at Trace located downstairs in front of the W hotel in downtown Austin. I would say we had a party of about 20 or something ladies. The menu selection was limited but all very delicious options. We got things to share from the appetizers. I ordered the arugula salad and crab cakes as both my appetizer and entrée. I had fish tacos a few hours earlier and wasn't too hungry. I got to try my friends quail dish and pesto mac and cheese which were all very delectable. The quail was cooked to perfection and the pesto mac was so creamy and rich the goat cheese definitely set it off! Would definitely come back for date night.,4.0 star rating

"Hubby and I had dinner here Friday night after flying in from California on a full Southwest flight.  We checked into our room at the W (thanks to the complimentary glass of Prosecco, we were starting to unwind), then went to Trace, looking for a quick dinner nearby.Mary, our server, was warm, welcoming and very hospitable. We took advantage of our free drink coupons, and chose the Whiskey-A-Go-Go and the Papa Don't Peach cocktails.Hubby started with the Sunflower Pesto Mac & Cheese, followed by the Trace Butcher Burger.  He enjoyed both selections. I sampled the mac and cheese, and it was luscious and very cheesy, just the way it should be.I had the Easy Tiger bread, which came with 3 spreads: Smoky Barbacoa, Spicy Artichoke, and a Seed & Nut Butter.  All three were good, but I especially liked the last 2.  I was offered more bread when it looked like I needed more.  There was a slight charge, but it was worth it!For my entree, I chose the Charcuterie and Salumi board.  It included Cuba pate, Prosciutto, Mortadella, cream cheese-filled chile pepper chunks, Pastrami, whole grain mustard, cornichon and baguette slices.  So good!Hubby ordered a drink that he had at the XYZ Bar at the Aloft in Denver last year, and the bartender was able to concoct it for him.Our first dinner in Austin was a hit, thanks to the great wait staff and the terrific menu.  The only negative was the sound level of the room, which got pretty loud.",4.0 star rating
"All I have to say is that this was one of the top meals I've ever had.Went on a Wednesday and there were maybe 15 people, including us. The space is open, airy with a nice lay out and very cool, modern furniture.  Think Scandinavian Hipster.Being a sucker for pork, I went for the braised pork shank. This thing is braised for hours then lightly fried with this batter that resembled onion ring batter. So. Damn. Good.  It was fork tender, with pork falling off the bone. You bite into it and taste the lighlt, fried batter then the soft, perfectly seasoned to pork.My companion had the Wagyu beef hangar steak and ordered it medium rare. Let me tell you, THIS, was amazing. The sliced steak had this salty, peppery, smoky bark and as soon as you bit into it, your eyes just opened wide in pleasure.  Unfortunately, she did not think it was warm enough.  Our server apologized and offered to get her a new one. She politely declined and decided to eat it (I thought it was perfect).We ordered a couple of desserts that were just incredible:  the strawberry dulcey and the grapefruit custard merengue. The consensus was that both were very good, ""light"" and the perfect summer post dinner indulgence.  To our surprise, for the dinner trouble with her steak, our server said the chef sent us a third dessert and complimentary proseco.  Talk about taking care of your customers. Very cool.This third dessert was the homemade ice creams and sorbets. Perfect blend of sweet and tangy. Deliciousness!!!  This was definitely the best dessert of the three.What was also impressive was our server. Professional but not uptight, really sweet and friendly. She checked on us quite often and started small conversations everytime, which was rather pleasant.Stay classy Trace, stay clasy.",5.0 star rating
"This place is amazing!!! The food, the staff and the wines are all top notch. If you're looking for somewhere to get away from the everyday grind come drown in wine here.

"GREAT wine bar in the Second Street District.  Happy hour is M-F 4:00-6:30 - and it's $3 off flights and glasses of wine and special small plates that are discounted.  As a vegetarian, I can recommend the goat cheese beignets, bruschetta, and margherita pizza.  Just a reminder: the small plates are SMALL plates! Their dinner menu has a lot of great food!  I can't wait until it's winter again so I can order their grilled cheese and tomato basil soup!  I've also had and loved their roasted golden beets!  Other vegetarian options include: fig & gorgonzola bruschetta, cru house salad, crispy baby artichokes, caprese salad, cheese fondue, several pizzas, and cheese boards!  It's a classy, chill place!  Great place to sit and try some wines!",4.0 star rating
"Cru Wine Bar is the worst. They have the absolute worst service in the entire city of Austin with the rudest servers on the planet. We will NEVER be setting foot in this establishment ever again. We hope this place goes out of business soon, so something that is actually positive for the human race can appear in its place. We have never been so angry at a business in Austin like we have been with Cru. We gave this place 3 different chances on 3 separate occasions, and we had horrible experiences on all 3 occasions. That's it, Cru: 3 strikes you're out! Our most recent terrible experience took place on Monday night January 16th, when (once again) there was only ONE (1) waitress to serve the ENTIRE bar and restaurant. So, after waiting 30 minutes for this one waitress to finally help us at the bar, she was completely surly, rude, bitchy, bad-tempered, and unhelpful... and she was completely unknowledgeable about wines! She knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about wines, yet she supposedly works at a ""wine bar"". She couldn't answer a single question about wines, and we only asked 3 easy questions such as ""which red wines are more dry than sweet?"" We asked because we're not wine experts ourselves. Her lack of wine knowledge might have been okay if her attitude didn't scream, ""I hate my job and I hate my life, so I will be taking it out on every customer who comes in here."" She continually kept rolling her eyes at the few questions we asked her -- even though SHE was the one who couldn't answer them -- and she kept walking away from us mid-question to help other people in the establishment! Yes, she was the only one working, but there's a polite way & a rude way to handle the situation. She always chose the rude way.But it gets much worse. So much worse. It gets so bad that we are shaking with anger as we type this. Since we couldn't get any straight answers out of the waitress, we decided to just stick with some of the ""classic wines"" that we had heard of in the past. Yet this bitchy waitress kept telling us that they were ""out of stock"" of all the classic wines that you would expect a wine bar to carry: She said that they were ""out of stock"" of Cabernet and Pinot and Merlot and Malbec and Zinfandel. Um, what?! How in the hell can you be a wine bar, but not offer these STANDARD CLASSIC WINES to your customers? Think about that for a second: We couldn't order a glass of Cabernet, Pinot, Merlot, Malbec, or Zinfandel. Have you ever heard of such a ridiculous thing in your life from a ""wine bar""?? None of these 5 wines were available, because bitch said that they were ""out of stock"".Well guess what?? As we inquired further, it turns out that they WEREN'T out of stock at all, but the bitchy waitress would only allow us to order these classic wines if we were ordering an ENTIRE BOTTLE OF THESE WINES. In other words, she was trying to peddle the previously-opened ""wine blends"" to us (which we didn't enjoy) because she wanted to use up old bottles of wine instead of opening a new bottle of wine. Keep in mind that not only is this incredibly rude behavior from a wine bar, but please note that she didn't even volunteer this information until I kept asking her how a wine bar wouldn't carry classic wines on hand. Her attitude was so incredibly dismissive. We asked for samples of 2 different blends, which were both terrible (a Cab blend and a Malbec blend), but you would've thought from her attitude that we had asked her to do us the world's largest favor that she didn't want to do. She kept rolling her eyes, and she gave us the world's smallest wine samples that you have ever experienced in your entire lives. The wine samples were LESS than a sip of wine -- if this waitress would have spit in our mouths, there would have been far more liquid from her saliva than from these wine samples. It was her way of saying, ""Don't EVER come into this bar and ask for a wine sample.""After trying these 2 tiny wine samples that we didn't enjoy, we decided that we really didn't like the cruel atmosphere & uncomfortable environment that this bitchy waitress' attitude was creating for us, so we decided to leave and go next door to the W Hotel Bar instead.But before we left, are you ready for this?? This is the absolute worst affront and offense of all. This bitchy waitress charged us $12 for the 2 tiny wine samples! That's right -- for 2 nearly-invisible sips of wine that were less than a spit of saliva!! This bitch charged us $12 for basically breathing oxygen. Because this was supposed to be a romantic date that we were on, we didn't want to ruin the mood even further by arguing with the waitress even more, so we just paid the bill and left.Keep in mind that this was only 1 of 3 terrible experiences that we have had at Cru wine bar. If you want to hear more, send us a message on Yelp and we will extend this review to include the previous 2 horrible experiences as well.",1.0 star rating

"As a first time visitor to Texas I wasn't familiar with the Crú chain of wine bars. In fact we were left to choose this restaurant on our own, as our host(daughter)was busy this evening. We took a chance basically based on proximity to our guest apartment. The restaurant was quite crowded as the host greeted us at the door. After he explained to us that our choice was to eat at the noisy and crowded bar or at a available 'community'  table, we chose the latter. Our decision was partly made on the possibility that we might actually meet some Texans.(didn't happen)The service was great. Our waitress offered great detail about our choices of libations. I chose the white Pinot Grigio and my wife had a beer.Her tomato soup was very tasty, while my beet/fig salad left my mouth begging for more.She chose the lemon chicken while for my main course I went with the braised short ribs. Fantastic once again. We decided to share the cheese platter for dessert.I was expecting a selection of cheeses with some grapes and a few crackers. To my delight three crackers with blue cheese topped with foie gras arrived at our table....a rather pricey $18 I thought.The first bite changed my mind. DELICIOUS...and certainly not as guilty a choice as some of the other sweet desserts.After dinner, Maron, the host/manager came over to our table. The restaurant had become quieter, so we could talk. We exchanged a bit of our personal stories. He's a delightful guy.Although not great world travelers, we've been around to many top-notch restaurants over the yearsI would have to include Crú as one of the top ten meals I've ever eaten",5.0 star rating

"A brilliant little wine bar! We came in here for drinks, and were pleased to see that they offer a happy hour! The happy hour offers discounted champagne, bottles of wine, and some of their appetizers. The decor is nice, paintings of giant wine labels adorn the walls.

Many places just chill all whites to the same temp. Not these guys!They offer beer, but with a very limited selection.

"I went here with a group of friends on a Wednesday night and really enjoyed it! We came around 9 pm so the restaurant was relatively empty but I imagine it was more crowded early on at happy hour. The happy hour menu seemed have tons of cheap eats and we all agreed that we would be back for it. Cru has a large wine list that has options for just about every price point. If your not ready to settle on one type of wine, they do offer wine flights. One of my friends chose this option and the glasses had medium sized portions. They also have a decent sized menu with great options to pair with wine like cheese boards and pizzas. I shared the roasted chanterelle mushroom with a friend and I would highly recommend it, although it was a little greasier than other stone fired pizzas I've had.

"Yelp is a website by snowflakes for snowflakes.Yelp deleted my review because a snowflake said I did a personal attack on someone there. That's a lie. I never named anyone. I never described them outside of stature and hair color (as if that'll leave an impression in a city full of people of such stature and hair color). I'll recreate the review with censored parts referring to humans, though, so the snowflakes who need restaurant reviews to be safe spaces don't get scared by anger at a convincing, miraculous portrayal of speech-capable brain death.However, in the interest of fairness so everyone knows what a true personal attack looks like, I'll refer the reader to the current smorgasbord of Elites crying to one another about how a bartender they shared photos of at The Nomad is a filthy Black-hating racist, and the Hispanic owner is a filthy troll who loves racism. Cuz that's not personal at all. yelp.com/biz/nomad-bar-a… (shout out to Scott T for his mafioso sensibilities about human rights). It pays to be an Elite if you want to attack people by name and photo because you waited too long for a drink.***I wish I could say the food tastes good.I mean, technically, I ate here once and it was okay but unmemorable.

""At the moment, we don't have anything."" This lie echoes in my head:I trundle to the bar. We drink and talk, waiting. I see a table of four get seated at a table for two. I see tables get cleared left and right and people plop down in them. I see a couple tuck into a table for four. I contemplate strangling myself in full view of the incompetent [people who are paid to help people get chairs in a restaurant they want to dump 10% of a paycheck on] in protest of my inability to get food at a table.What the fuck does PRIORITIZE mean, La Condesa? Do your [disproportionately soft-skined seating staff] know what that word means? Do they mean it?

"Came here for lunch and got the Guacamole Tasting for an appetizer. The seasonal topping guac was my favorite, it had strawberries, and was very sweet and filling. The Chipotle and the Traditional ones were very good too. Sweet and smooth textures. For my tacos I got the Pollo Rostizado. The cilantro and salsa really complimented it and it made for a good taco. The second taco I got was the Alambre one. That was my favorite. The Salsa Chipotle was amazing and delicious and the taco was amazing. For dessert I got the Boca Negra, a flourless chocolate cake, and it was unique. It was a bit spicy since it has chipotle, but it would've been better without it. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my visit.

"If you haven't sensed a theme in my reviews by now, they're pretty much always about happy hours. My dining out is essentially limited to happy hours and tacos. So, naturally, this review is about the La Condesa happy hour.The ambiance in this place is really great. The decorations are unique, and the patio area is super nice. The happy hour is only available in the bar area or on the patio, but there's generally enough seating to go around (especially on nice days!). Before you even look at the menu, do yourself a favor and order the guacamole taster and a La Condesa Margarita. Seriously, trust me on this one. You'll all be fighting over the chipotle guac with slivered almonds while sipping your delicious drinks. It also comes with four salsas, which are equally tasty. Be warned, the sopas and tostadas are really, really tiny here. I'm not exaggerating. Like, if I gave a La Condesa tostada to a small child, they'd be like, ""Thanks, lady, this is almost enough food for my rabbit!"" But they're also AMAZING. Like, mind-blowingly delicious. Just be prepared, and don't expect a Texas-sized tostada because you will be disappointed.The service can be a bit slow here at times, but everyone is super polite and friendly and we've never left feeling like we didn't get what we needed. Although the prices are pretty huge discounts from what this restaurant normally charges for food, I wouldn't consider this a ""cheap"" happy hour.

"Everything was absolutely delicious, from the cocktail Alma Blanca, to the fabulous salsa sampler with guacamole. I couldn't even decide which salsa was the best! The star for me was the ceviche... both the Acapulco and Hamachi were fabulous ! Also had the octopus which was cooked to perfection but I wasn't expecting a tomato sauce so not my favorite but still yummy.  The service was also fantastic.  I would definitely recommend this place if you like a finely crafted cocktail and are craving some delicious ceviche and salsa :)",5.0 star rating
If you come to visit this establishment here is a list of things you will need or should do. 1: Bring your own salt and pepper shakers2: Do NOT come hungry 3: Take your grandfathers old hammer and crack miss piggy (aka your piggy bank) open or take a small loan out 4: Bring a flash light in case your eyes are not cat like Ok here we go-- We ordered the guacamole with chips as an appetizer which tasted ok but definitely was not worth the $12 price tagThe entrees were way over priced for the portion that you receive. The chicken mole had very very little mole sauce with it. True chicken mole is smothered in it. This restaurant was classified as Mexican which is wrong. This is a tapas style restaurant that has you spending your hard earned $$ for little in return. The flavor of the food was alright but not worth the high price tag. Not a very good example of a tapas restaurant. Service was ok but here again not quite what should be given for the amount you to shell out.,1.0 star rating

"Definitely a sushi ""bar"" as the name states. The place at first seemed more alcohol oriented then food... the waitresses were dressed kind of provocatively which emphasized that feeling for me. We came in for lunch and it was fairly empty, even though the restaurant is fairly large. The dim lighting might have had something to do with it. From outside you couldn't see anything and the decor inside was pretty nice but not presented well at lunch due to the darkness. Although the food turned it all around for them. Up till then based on what I was seeing I had slight doubt but the food was great! The salad was ok, the miso soup was nice and flaverful. The rolls changed everything!!! It was top class for that price. Nice and fatty, juicy, and spicy! They get the 4 star cause I can tell this is more of a night time place in which I can see it being a very fun and lively place, which also happens to have great sushi",4.0 star rating
"We came for dinner around 7pm on Thursday April 13th. There were 2-3 staff members at the hostess stand and were seated immediately. No one approached the table. A few minutes later a 4-top was seated immediately, given drinks and had their order taken. Still not approached. 10 minutes go by. Another table was then seated and a server immediately took their order. Long story long, we were there for 15 minutes and no one came by our table while others were served. They need to get their shit together.",1.0 star rating

I got the sushi/ sashimi platter which was delicious on their own, but the waitress (Poy?) gave a great suggestion of adding fresh wasabi to it! Man what a kick! And to finish off such a great meal, I ordered the tempura ice cream which is never a disappointment. Thanks for the amazing service and food guys:)",5.0 star rating
"This is my FAVORITE sushi place!After being told about this place several times from a good friend of mine, she finally brought me on a rainy day and I've been hooked ever since. My boyfriend and I always take advantage of their happy hour every single Saturday (with some Fridays mixed in, of course.)I have tried several rolls, mainly the ones on their happy hour list, and have happily settled on choosing the same two every weekend. Their Longhorn Roll is a fried roll, drizzled with soy sauce and stuffed with cream cheese. You can never go wrong with cream cheese! My other favorite roll is their crunchy roll, which is so simple and fresh that I crave it all the time. They never skimp on the avocado that comes inside the roll. My boyfriend loves their spicy salmon roll, which is basically what it sounds like, and their Hot Roll, which is another fried roll that has a hint of garlic and a hint of sweet. You have to take advantage of their fried calamari during their happy hour. They give you such a large portion and their remoulade sauce served on the side is to die for. During their reverse happy hour on Friday and Saturday night they have a live DJ and super cheap drinks. This is when the place can get packed, but we have never had poor service. On our last visit it was busy but our waiter was so apologetic. We have always had excellent service and we have been seen by several different staff. They really take care of you!I couldn't recommend this place more. Definitely check out their happy hour menu when you can. They have a lot to offer on it.",5.0 star rating
"Husband and I decided to try this place out for the first time on New Years Eve for their Happy Hour menu. They were not doing happy hour that day. Would have been nice if they mention that on the website.  We were in and out in 30 min. Quick service is great, but not when it means your sushi was made in advance and certain items were fried twice. Uni tastes rancid. Waitress was obviously aware we were displeased but didn't bother to ask how our meal was. $54 for a half-hour meal that left us both nauseous. Never again.",1.0 star rating

The ambiance was definitely not.",3.0 star rating
"Very attractive space, particularly the main restaurant, with a hip, trendy vibe. Service was lightening fast, and the sushi was as fresh as a pet goldfish just fished from the bowl. Didn't taste like goldfish, though, particularly the specialty rolls with wonderful combos of aquatic dwellers. We had a rainbow roll and a big easy roll. I'd recommend both. The sake flight was a new twist, tasty and fun. The tempura veggies were light and not greasy, although the shrimp was a different sort of tempura batter that was better suited to catfish. The tempura banana dessert was meh, greasy, unfortunately, and the predictable whipped cream and chocolate drizzle did nothing to enhance the dish. Would return though, overall an enjoyable meal. I'd skip dessert next time.",4.0 star rating
"I wish they had pictures....it would have really helped with my ordering.I ordered what sounded to be delicious. I was wrong.They have a lunch special menu and if I can remember there was section B where I chose 2 rolls.I'll state something that is my opinion: I do not like California rolls! So, after I ordered I was very disappointed to see that the two items looked exactly like California rolls. I didn't want to waste the food and I also didn't want to take it home either. I forced myself to eat it. The beer helped with washing it down....yaaay beer!My friend was nice enough to share at least one roll from each of her choices that she ordered. She ordered correctly.Would I go back? I'm not sure. I really really hope they consider putting pictures of the rolls on their menu to help their customers with choosing wisely.",2.0 star rating

"My girlfriend and myself tried this place for the first time after going to another sushi restaurant here in Austin for the past several years. We went during their 'reverse happy hour (9pm-midnight) on a Saturday night. Wasn't too crowded but full, nice ambience, and they had a DJ (the music wasn't too loud). Our server Jared took care of us from the get-go. I ordered some beer and nigori saki (part of their happy hour) and we sampled two apps (gyoza and tuna tacos). Apps were about $4 each. Then we ordered several 'house speciality' rolls, as we both were starving and wanted to sample their menu. We each had a longhorn roll (tempura fried), I had a spicy salmon roll, she had a rainbow roll, and then I ordered a shaggy dog roll (I think that's what it was called..). Except for the rainbow roll, all rolls were part of their happy hour and were around $7 a piece. For dessert, we had their banana tempura w/ ice cream, which was $4. Everything was delicious, reasonably priced, and rolls were promptly brought out as the night went on. Our server Jared was nice, and made sure we were enjoying our evening on a consistent basis. I thoroughly enjoyed myself there, and I'll definitely be back, soon.",5.0 star rating

"The sushi here is average. I dropped by late on a Friday night with my sister, and the place was packed. I'm guessing people come here for the vibes, since they have a DJ filling the room with club bangers.The reverse happy hour is the best thing about this place. I was a fan of their sangria, and you can't really go wrong with sake.Overall, pretty fun atmosphere and I'd come back, but don't expect great sushi. If you're needing to drown rolls in thick, creamy sauces, your sushi game is probably pretty weak.",3.0 star rating

"Not bad but not amazing. My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and friends from work raved about this place. He got the Sushi and said it was decent and he also got shrimp, fried rice but was not a fan. There were so many onions in it and he doesn't like onions, so he picked around and maybe had 2 bites. He just wanted a side of it and they brought out a HUGE plate full of it. I am not a sushi person so I got teriyaki chicken with steamed rice. It wasn't terrible but I have had better. The service was ok... the waitress asked if we wanted anything else, and if we wanted out check as we both had half full plates, so I felt a little rushed. It was pretty dead in there, not many customers, so I was confused as to why she was hurrying... it was 7pm. Overall, it wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either.",3.0 star rating

"This is my favorite pizza place in town. The food is awesome but it's not just the food that makes it my favorite. The staff is genuinely from Italy and they are super friendly and nice. They remember you if you've been there a few times, even what you want to order. It's a small place but it's relaxing. I wouldn't take a group of more than six people there and expect to sit together because of its size. I just came back from Rome and I ate a lot of pizza and I can honestly say the pizza here is as good or better than what I had in Italy. It's still very traditional but with more flavor. They also have one of the best Caesar dressing I've ever had. It's a creamy one made in house. I'm trying to convince them to bottle and sell it. Wink wink.",5.0 star rating

"Like apathetic hungry zombies, we began wandering aimlessly looking for a bite to eat on that side of town one evening. It went a little something like this: Him ""you want Mexican?""Me ""nahhh.""Him, gesturing across the street  ""okay. Well, do you want BBQ?""Me, contemplating at a crosswalk ""nah, I don't want to break out into meat sweats tonight. It's too hot outside.""Collectively, we continued to dismiss and excuse a multitude of West Second Street options. Hungry and apathetic is one of the worst combinations.Two blocks later, after window shopping at Urban Outfitters, strolling past ACL Moody's upcoming show posters and Violet Crown's latest indie releases, we began to approach the end of the street. We were essentially out of options.Until the red and yellow sign yelled from up above, ""Hey - up here! Look at me. I'm cozy and yummy.""We obliged. Admittedly, we'd never noticed this spot. Ever. And we've spent a lot of time on West Second St.Apparently Numero28 exists in several locations in New York City, Miami, London and Austin. Our darling, authentically Italian server was quick to educate us on the history, menu and pronunciations. the menu boasts the expected collection of Italian epicuriocities such as pizzas, mistas, carpaccios, cured meats and cheese and pastas. The unexpected part, though, was how tasty the pizza was. I accept the challenge to devour anything spicy, so we opted for the Diavola. It was the perfect sharable. Red sauce base, mozzarella cheese and spicy salami. I sweet talked our server into some basil, too.The wine is served in three different options - glass, carafe and by the bottle. I also accept the challenge to throw back some vino, so I guarded a the carafe on my own. The guy got his own so we could taste both. Its also great if you're indecisive between two bottles. Speaking of wine, I lack wine snobbery, so perhaps they're not FABULOUS bottle offerings, but they certainly are reasonably priced.To no fault of the restaurant, there was a cackling group of over-wined early 20-somethings who made the experience a little less enjoyable throughout our visit. Its a small restaurant and the group took up over half of the space, so escaping wasn't an option unless it meant ending our night early.Despite that alll of the thumbs are up for this joint.",4.0 star rating

"Oh my! This place was amazing for food! I would have given it the full 5 stars, but the vulture like staff made the experience a little bitter. Although the place does not have your conventional wood fired pizza stove, the pizzas come out so delicious. The dough is what every place making pizzas  should take note of. Who can say no to a hot pizza with a red sauce that literally makes you want to break into the kitchen to see what kind of tomatoes are being used. Numero 28 does not disappoint! The Eggplant Parmesan is also to die for! I am certainly glad that I do not live closer for fear that I would trot in more regularly to enjoy the authentic southern Italian flavors. I was a bit perplexed when the arancini, which you can order vegetarian, came out as one large app. Usually they are balls so it was interesting to try this version. Salads are pretty standard.The sauce is so tasty, that it makes one realize how rare it is to find a red sauce that is made to perfection. Enough gushing about the sauce, I know.The ambiance is very neighborhood walk-in and pretty casual. This was made apparent as people let their children and pets run amuck. Don't let the staff make you feel like they are hovering or judging your selections. We understand you are authentic Italian but that shouldn't mean you make people feel uncomfortable with your stares. Sexism does not equal a better tip.",4.0 star rating

This is a nice little pizzeria. I was visiting and was in the mood for pizza since i couldn't find pizza by the slice close enough. The pizza was good but I'm such a sticklee coming from the east coast. The center of the pizza is not as crunchy as I would like. I think it'd soft because of the toppings.

"Excellent food, service, and ambience. Great place for Italian and pizza. Came here for lunch for the first time the other day, dined outside, and enjoyed every moment of it. I felt bad because they close at 2:15pm and we came around 1:50pm but they were more than happy to serve us. We started off with the ""frittura di calamari e zucchine"" (fried calamari and zucchini) and the ""arancina tradizionale"" (saffron rice ball) per the recommendation of the staff and we were not disappointed. Both appetizers were great. Shared the 18-inch ""Austin"" pizza with the bro and LOVED that they used fresh jalapeños. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? No. But it was better than average and definitely enjoyable. Ziti alla ""Norma"" was also solid - perfect lunch portion too.I've been really into Spanish guitar lately cuz it's got me feeling some type of way so when I heard it here I was pleasantly surprised. It upped my opinion of this place. Our server came to check on us very often and brought our food out to us promptly. Other staff members also came to our table to ask us how the food was as well.

"I'm a sushi novice. I haven't given it many chances. Came to Umi on a Friday night with a few friends who love this place. We got there just before the Reverse Happy Hour started, 9:30-close on the weekend. The restaurant is in a strip mall right off I35, but the interior and restrooms were much nicer than I expected. The happy hour menu is very extensive, with awesome deals on rolls, saki, apps, and other alcoholic choices. We opted for carafes of saki and some Asian beer. My favorite food item was the Tiger Eye roll which was smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, and jalapeño. Husband liked the Spicy Tuna roll and beef skewers.  Neither of us like raw sushi, so it was nice to have a variety of choices. The Crunchy roll wasn't amazing, but everything else we tried we enjoyed. The price was great too, so so affordable!

Umi is still the closest sushi to my office so I'm sure I'll still visit from time to time, but next time I'll just call in my order and take up a person's time and hog the phone line.

Then about half way through I just didn't want anymore but I paid all this money for it got up out of bed I was going to eat it. I ended up just picking out things to eat from the roll.

"This is was our first time dining at Umi and I'm a sushi novice, so our server Catherine was super awesome and helpful with suggestions on what to order and what wouldn't freak me out! We went with our two boys (13 and 6) and had the Amazon local deal for dinner for 4, which includes 2 appetizers, 4 rolls and 2 desserts. We are totally stuffed and have happy tummies! Appetizers were the dumplings (yum!) and calamari (delish and tender) - the rolls we chose were the longhorn (absolutely amazing-next time we will get two!), hot mama (so good), the hot as hell without jalapeños (my husband is a wimp! - but it was still tangy and had a great spice to it) and we got the rainbow roll (which I bravely tried thanks to Catherine for being my cheerleader and it was fresh and more traditional. We were able to get a very rare sampling of black tuna that they just caught the day before and as far as the other fish, my husband said that it tasted very fresh!). Dessert (as if we needed to eat more!) was the tempura cheesecake and tempura banana with vanilla ice cream (both were very delectable but I'm a sucker for cheesecake so I'll get that again for sure!). Overall, I was very impressed with the restaurant, the service, and more importantly the food!

We went a Saturday around noon and it was nice. It only had a few people around it. It was decorated quite nicely. We order the dinner for two and starting off was a salad and soup. The soup wasnt in my taste it had way too much ginger and tasted over salted. The salad with honey (I forgot the name of the dressing) was really good! Then came the sushi. The fried rolls were great but the raw sushi didn't look or tasted fresh. The staff was friendly and helpful with the menu. It was pricey but I wasn't impressed with the food.

Owners and staff are always the best! I have never had anything here that I do not like (and we have been here many, many times over the years)! This is one of my favorite places. The happy hour specials on food are great, as well. Do not pass this place up if you are looking for sushi, Japanese appetizers, or a great bento box!",5.0 star rating
"So do you like Hip Hop, R&B, and Rap?  Do you like Sushi?  Do you like Bars?  Do you like Happy Hour?  Do you have 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one?  In the 90's did you think about Pimpin Wood Wheel?If your answers to the above questions are yes, then you need Umi's reverse happy hour in your life.  Thursdays 9-11pm and Fri/Sat 9-12pm are the times to go.  I love starting off a weekend night getting some sushi at the bar ,chilling to some tunes, and getting cheap drinks with friends, before going out on the town.  I have been here quite a few times, but by no means am I a regular.  I always have a great time when I come to reverse happy hour.  The staff is chill and funny, but they are not going to kiss your ass like some D-Town high dollar spots.  They get packed on the weekends, and do their best to keep your drinks and food coming.  Good selection of sushi and drinks with the HH specials.  If you are on the Southeast side of Austin, I think you will be happy you tried this place out on a weekend night before you head into more trouble.",4.0 star rating
Happy hour everyday and reverse happy hour and it's not downtown. Win! The longhorn roll was delish! Nice crunch on the outside. Perfect with the cold lychee sake.We also had their teriyaki chicken dinner which was also good. There was no wait on a Saturday early evening. Our server was friendly and attentive.I want to come back to try more of their rolls. I see another happy hour in my near future.,4.0 star rating

"Back here after 3 years and this place is still rocking!!This smoothies and juices are out of this world for me, the taste is fantastic, you can make exactly what you want, add as many items as you want and the price is right!!The place is always spotless and whoever works here is really friendly.Hope I won't have to wait another 3 years to come back...",5.0 star rating
Serious juice bar with high property drinks. The menu is a little intimidating but the drinks we ordered were just right and kept us energized enough to explore the city all afternoon. Prices were high but at least the quality in the drinks was high as well.,4.0 star rating
"Atmosphere was okay, nothing special! But the staff was friendly and the juice was very good! After a week of drinks and spicy food I needed to hydrate and I was very happy with the Daily Juice Cafe! I also tried their bulletproof coffee and was in love! Get it with butter or coconut oil, either way you cannot go wrong!",4.0 star rating

Great little juice joint. Got the Birds of Paradise juice that was made to order and was delicious. I also got the bullet coffee that had coconut oil. But I also tasted the bullet coffee with butter which was just as good. So don't be scared and give this place a try.,4.0 star rating
"Decided to stop here for lunch and wasn't too impressed. The lady that was working the register wasn't too friendly. You'd figure that when you say it's your first time, she'd want to show you their options of what they have to offer. I ended up going with the gluten free wrap which was pretty good. Then I decided on the berry acai bowl size small which came out too watery, in my opinion. Total for those 2 was $20. Later I found that they had sauces that wouldn't been a good addition to my wrap. Such as the sriracha. It looks like the place has potential, I just wasn't serviced well.",3.0 star rating
"Austin is rich with juice and smoothies options downtown, but Daily Juice will always be a top pick by me. I love their food options, especially the fire kale salad, which is slathered with a creamy, spicy cashew dressing. All of the eats are prepared, ready to grab and go, so there's no wait at all. Plus, everything has nutrients information printed on the boxes, if you're into that sort of thing. The cherry on top (or perhaps the acai berry, in this case) is that the staff are so nice. I was hanging out, mooching off the free wifi, and they offered me the leftovers of TWO smoothie experiments they were toying with, no charge. This is one chain I can fully endorse. I wish they would broaden their horizons and open up outside of Austin! For now, it will remain a healthy treat whenever I come to visit.",5.0 star rating

"Came in for a daily cleanse. I received excellent customer service and even a tip on how to save money! I got in and out within 5 minutes -- no line. I recieved the ""Standard Cleanse."" The juices taste fresh! We'll see how I  like it. So far, I've had the Pure & Simple bottle - was a little sweet but really great. I think it was the apple inside. Now I'm having the Balance bottle which is the same as Pure & Simple but has ginger in it, as well! This was was slightly less sweet. If this is your first juice cleanse, I'd highly recommend. If you're like me and don't care too much for sweetness, I'd go with the ""Lower Sugar Cleanse."" I think I'm going to order that tomorrow and see how it goes! As for weight loss? I'll give y'all an update! (I know it's not supposed to be taken for weight loss, more like a kick start to better health, but I have a wedding coming up and my dress is a little too tight right now!) haha",5.0 star rating

"After a few days of dining in Austin, I NEED Daily Juice.  I don't quite know the difference between getting a freshly squeezed juice versus one of the pre-bottled juices in the front coolers - both tasted the same to me, but both were really good.  They serve pre-packaged food items and most of the salads I had have been filling and tasty. (Try the Tahini Sunflower Wrap!) This is a juice place, so you aren't going to get out cheaply, but you will feel better eating good food - or at least you'll feel better for trying to eat good food.",4.0 star rating
"3:30pm 10/09/2016... ordered a couple of juices waited 15 minutes before being told the juicer doesn't work. I was asked if I wanted a smoothie instead. ""Sure, why not""I was refunded for my juices, but the gentleman charged me for the now more expensive drinks...Staying patient, I waited 15 more minutes before being told they can't make a smoothie either. - I was then told I'll be refunded... no receipt was issued then I was told ""you're good, man"" 30 minutes for no juice? Terrible service. I will advise my network to use JuiceLand. Will not be back.In fact, I went to JuiceLand immediately after. I was treated very well and was given a free 'Noni to worry' shot by the gracious host. I tipped heavy that time. $6 on an $18 tab.",1.0 star rating

"I stopped in to Daily Juice Cafe on a rainy ATX morning on my way into work on a business trip for a smoothie around 8 am.Daily Juice has a large menu of fresh smoothies, juices, and pre-made healthy food items like wraps and salads. I opted for the Green Republic: Kale, Spinach, Banana, Coconut Water, Almond Butter.I was in and out of there in less than 5 minutes with a tasty smoothie. One nice touch was that the smoothie came with a fairly wide straw, which is preferable, IMO, to a flimsy thin straw, especially with a thicker smoothie. Cost was about $8, which to my San Francisco self, seemed standard.I'd definitely return if I come back to the area!",4.0 star rating

"Oh my Gawd!  You are high if you think this is a good restaurant.  The food is mediocre and the prices are INSANELY high.  You can have a much better meal at the fraction of the cost.  Things that are a more efficient way of spending your money:  use it as kindling, use it as toilet paper, give it to the Trump campaign.  All things that are a waste of money.  Also, their shitty servers charge 24% gratuity for groups.  That was not consensual.  Don't even get me started on the joke of a wine list.  Worst wine list I've ever seen!  Suffice to say, I will not be going back.",1.0 star rating
"We went to Trace for a special Christmas Day 3 course dinner with family. The beet salad appetizer was odd, no greens, popcorn sprinkled on top, flavor was just ok. The specialty biscuits were hard, over cooked, and more like a ciabatta roll in texture. The prime rib was nothing special taste-wise. My husband got the smallest rack of lamb entree and left hungry. The desserts left something to be desired. I was very disappointed, given my high expectations from the good reviews. We will not be going back.",3.0 star rating
"I can definitely see why TRACE receives so many mixed reviews. Dining here is kind of like riding an over-hyped, costly roller coaster...up...down...up...down...at the end you feel a slight thrill in your stomach...and then a little dizzy - after paying the high price for the less than stellar experience you just had. Locale: Inside the downtown Austin W, the décor is swank without being cheesy. Modern, sharp lines with calming, cool color scheme. Nice. Food philosophy: I really like TRACE's approach and respect for food. ""...cuisine with a conscience is foraged, farmed, crafted, hunted and shared utilizing the freshest, peak-of-the-season local and regional ingredients, supporting sustainable, renewable and organic food and beverage products.""  Menus changed often based on what's available, so they offer a great variety; however, I just wish they would step it up in the kitchen a bit - explanation to follow. The service: Really great. From the reservation person, the bartender, management, and restaurant wait staff - all really friendly and accommodating. Food and drink - HH & DINNER REVIEWS:  Happy Hour Review:Pickle Pot for $5 was a big hit. Filled with handcut seasonal veggies (e.g., beets, carrots, etc.), perfectly pickled (not too sour), and served with yum bread and 2 generous chunks of white cheddar. Adorable preso, great value, and pairs perfectly with a vodka soda (Titos for $4.63 during HH; regularly $10). Mushroom Gratin, again for 5 bucks, was even a bigger hit! Creamy, tasty gooey gorgeous skillet of molten cheese served with large crustinis to spoon all of the goodness on...oh my! Went well with local Austin Beerworks Fire Eagle (HH $3.70; usually still only $5).*** Great happy hour! Nice ambience, really good apps on the cheap, and decent drink specials. A+!Dinner Review: Sadly, not nearly as successful. Apps - ""Tiger Bread"": Served with 3 infused butters. 6 bucks ($3 per refill).  Pretty to look at; however, I fail to experience all of the enthusiasm people seem to have for the locally baked loafs. As a true carb-o-nator, I find Tiger Bread to be A-OK, but nothing special [there is currently an Austinite trying to snipe me - sorry]. And frankly, the butter lacked in flavor, very mild, and could only tell a very subtle (if at all) difference between the three (and I modestly must add I have a great palette).  Sweetbreads: Large appetizer portion of creamy, well-battered and cooked thymus glands. Just a tad salty but, nice and buttery inside as they should be. Perfect light golden brown fry. Can easily share for $13.00.Scallops:  2 ""diver"" scallops; opaque, not over-cooked; however, where is the SEAR? Why do so many restaurants, particularly ""fine dining"" establishments, have such a difficult time cooking scallops?! Frustrating and disappointing.  Accompanying cotechino sausage chunks had a heavy sear, which I actually like on sausage - almost to the point of being over-done, while providing that yummy flavor that screams carcinogens - all with a light drizzle of a lentil vinaigrette on the plate. Great potential, but huge fail on execution of the scallops and rather small serving.  $16 price tag stung a little. Entrées - Belle Duck: Very uninviting presentation. The entire plate just looked ""grey.""  What the duck? Not what was expected. Not a nicely cooked, sliced duck breast; rather little bits throughout whatever the rest of the dish was. At $36 not memorable at all.  Ribeye: Brainless, right? At the time, was the most expensive entrée on the menu and when delivered to the table couldn't help but almost gasp at the small size of the steak. VERY thin cut - like the ones you might buy in a ""family pack"" for about $8/lb in your local market. Ordered mid-rare; more med-well. Flavor okay, but ""where's the beef?!"" Sides - Yup, one of those places - a la carte - White Cheddar Grits with worcestershire butter. More than al dente grits, super greasy, just not good. Tiny, single serve portion for $7 not worth it. Desserts - Neither my husband or I have huge sweet tooths; however, I would be remiss not to acknowledge (and admit) that TRACE has one of the most amazing pastry chefs in Austin! Chef Angel is very innovative and creates tiny sweet plates of art (she even does gluten free options if that's your thing). Truly amazing! If TRACE were dessert only, it would certainly earn 5+ stars. Whatever you choose, you can't go wrong!OVERALL:TRACE is a great place for HH eats and drinks, and then maybe dessert...just skip the dinner...for now. It has great potential in my opinion, and can only get better from here...so I hope.",3.0 star rating
"We came here for a snack before dinner and wanted my daughter to eat her late lunch here.  Chicken fingers - for a children's menu, the food was made very well!  The chicken fingers were lightly battered.  The fries were parboiled and mixed to bring out the extra starch which made them the best!Cheese/Charcuterie Tray - this was just okay.  The cheeses were all a bit strong.  It would have been nice to have a mix of some mild and some more pungent.  The toasted bagguets were perfect.We came the following morning for brunch - Shrimp and Grits -  The cheesy grits had a great consistency and the shrimp and sausage were delicious.  It was quite a filling portion for brunch.Smoked salmon and bagel - beautiful presentation and serving size was large.Service was very friendly.  They were very accommodating to daughter as well.  I'm looking forward to having a dinner here the next time we are in town.",5.0 star rating
"Austin was a great server (and a fellow NW raised kid). The 3 course Valentine's Day dinner was outstanding in flavor and portion size.

"It semi-fascinates me how well I get along with my ex, I don't recall feeling that way when we were married. And since we had just successfully concluded a negotiation regarding our daughter, I generously offered to take her to dinner at Trace. I had the $100 Yelp gift certificate. I'm not an idiot.We did a Sunday evening service, and split the Easy Tiger bread, grilled kale salad, rib eye, a side of fries, and the chocolat au lait dessert. We didn't drink, and it was more than enough food. The service was great, and the Trace ambiance is W's typical vision of urban upscale hipster. A pleasant & enjoyable experience. Would it have been as pleasant & enjoyable if I had paid $94.68 for it, in addition to my $25 tip? Probably not. But this was the third time I've formally dined at Trace, and the third chef whose menu I've seen. This one has been the best so far. Let's see if there are any other changes.I don't have a clever ending here, so I'll leave you with Bourdain 101 - try to book your dinner reso for a Wednesday through Saturday service, when you know the head chefs are working the line. It's usually their personal execution that will make or break their menu. At least when you walk out, you won't be leaving with a trace of doubt.",3.0 star rating
"I attended the yelp elite event at Trace and it was amazing, so I expected no less on my return visit using that super generous gift card.  I was a bit disappointed that the desserts from that evening had not made it to the main menu yet (except for the beet yogurt).We were warmly greeted and definitely pampered.  Mary took great care of us.  We started with appetizers - the Tiger Bread with special butters (heavenly), Scallops, & Potato & Cheese soup.  I ordered the drum and it was okay.  He ordered the Paella & Onion Rings.  The onion rings were superb.  He liked his Paella.  The drinks were good.  I had the Spiced Ginger Lemonade, he ordered an Old Fashioned & Makers 46 shot.  But what kind of really killed the good vibe here was that they charged $2 for Rocks for his shot.  Seriously?  I get that we're in a drought, but $2 for ice is just plain crazy, just charge $23 for the drink and we won't be insulted.  They comped our dessert (the amazing beet yogurt &  a maple something something) which was unexpected and appreciated and even sent us home with a surprise of 3 bite size desserts that were enjoyed the next day.  Overall, a very nice evening if not for the stinginess of charging $2 for rocks.  Seriously think about that one, folks.",4.0 star rating
"Short version:  BFF and I were treated like visiting royalty last nite.  The food was great and the service was stellar.  We'll be back.Loooong, delicious x-rated food porn version:  I omit it.  I ate here because I had a hefty gift card to use and BFF has been nagging me to try this place for years.  He loves the W, loves fancy and swank, but *I* am Klassy with a ""Kuh"".  Knowing that he and I can never have a bad time, I was all too happy to treat his hardworking self to dinner (yah, right, he still picked up the substantial bar tab :).  Wednesdays seem to be a great quiet evening to get to know this restaurant.  We met the manager, Will, upon entering and he made a point to stop by our table to chat and check up on us.  In fact, BFF and I were elbow deep in our appetizers, divine scallops and a generous cheese plate (btw, who goes to the trouble of smoking dates?  WHO??  Trace, that's who), when he announced the chef wanted to provide us with an ""interim course"".  We knew we had filling entrees coming and still about a half pound of bleu cheese to slog through, but we gamely agreed :)That is when Chef Jen came by with a beautiful plate of ""something I just whipped up for you"": seared tuna with celery curls, tiny grape slivers and CUCUMBER FOAM.  It was a thing of beauty (check the pix) and after my first bite, I was willing to stab BFF in the throat for the rest of that refreshing and light foam.  When I asked Chef Jen if this was to be on their new spring menu (coming end of March) she replied, ""nope, I just thought it up.  It gives me a chance to express myself.""  To which I invited her to feel free to express herself all over our table.  See?  Kuhlassy :)For entrees, BFF got the lamb vindaloo special of the nite which came on a plate with a sea of CUCUMBER FOAM.  So, see?  I didn't have to stab him after all.  Glad I didn't.  I got the Cassoulet, aka Pork Five Ways.  A portion of pork sausage, pork chop and pork belly sitting atop beans cooked in pork juice, generously sprinkled with pork cracklings.  To a Porkivore like myself, this was heaven.Somehow we struggled through dessert as well, sharing the maple creme de pot, altho I must admit I am not much of a maple fan but the presentation was gorgeous.  At some point, Will the GM left and Ryan the nite GM came in and he made sure to check on us as well.  David our server was also super attentive and Chef Jen even came out again to hear our final verdict on dinner.  Is this what it's like to be Anthony Bourdain???  dang.I don't know why I dragged my feet about eating here for so long.  The gift card helped for sure, but I think I was intimidated by the fanciness of it.  I realized last nite, I should not be intimidated, I should embrace it and live it!  I could certainly get used to that kind of treatment, as we all should as customers.  I have since gotten on their email list for upcoming events and look forward to checking out their ""Crafts and Craft Cocktails"" events.  Booze and scissors and glue sound like a great combination!",5.0 star rating

"I'm going to preface this review with Fergie's Glamorous because I was feeling this when I was here:Poppin' champagneLivin' my lifeIn the fast laneAnd I won't changeFor the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy.Last weekend, I decided to use my $100 dollar gift card for a ""treat yo' self"" dinner. First off, the ambience here is spectacular. There's a little bit of everything for everyone: Plenty of natural lighting in the dining area; a dimly-lit, intimate, bar; and a beautiful alcove with string lights outside in the courtyard. Service was top notch; the hostess quickly seated me to my table outside in the courtyard which quickly followed the waitress providing me a menu and asking me what I wanted to drink. (She also helped me strategically place all my dishes out at the same time to take a photo. Yep, I'm the guy who shamelessly stands on the chair to take a top-down shot.) After picking several items that caught my eye, the head chef came out to speak with me to ensure that I didn't have any dietary restrictions as well as mentioning that she would include a complimentary dish that I was sure to enjoy (scallops yall!). The dishes I tried for the night:-Endive Salad-Quail Dumplings-Agnolotti-Charcuterie and Salumi-Pot de Creme (think creme brûlée)The food: The Endive salad coupled with the Meyer lemon complemented each other very well and left me wishing there were more. The quail dumplings were matched perfectly together--a blend of savory (quail) and sweet (sweet potato dumplings) that was well-balanced--this is what umami is all about. The agnolotti had a generous amount of braised oxtail that was tender which I particularly enjoyed. The only dish I am slightly critical of were the scallops. I personally found it over salted that I couldn't appreciate the dish to the fullest. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and felt like a prince upon leaving--Thanks Trace!",4.0 star rating
"Thanks to this fun yelp event where we were kindly given a sweet and hefty gift card, I was able to treat myself and my friend to a yummy dinner. I had always wanted to give Trace a try, it just never ended up in the cards until now. I'm really glad it did and I will come back next time I'm feeling like a fancypants dinner night!We had great service and an explanation of the menu. We went on Friday, and I was worried it would be overly busy and service could be a miss. It was perfect. Parking was a snap, although I didn't even try the valet. Everything came out quickly, although our server said our entrees were taking awhile so they brought us a charcuterie/ fromage plate while we waited. Wow! It was delicious and I would come back just for that! I don't ever like pâté, but I liked theirs. That says a lot to me. And the cheeses, oh my!!! The cheeses! So, we started with the oysters, and split the watercress salad. Then I ordered the lamb vindaloo, which was the daily special. My friend ordered the striped bass. And for the grand finale we had the maple pot de creme! Oh my yum! So yum! Just so, so yum! I cannot express enough! The entrees were really excellent as well. I loved my lamb dish, but my friend's striped bass was melt in your mouth wonderful. And then there are the drinks! My friend had wine and loved it. I got the ""Winter in Jalisco"" and wow. It had mescal, a reposado, a chile liqueur, lime, and pomegranate. So much wow! At the end of our meal the manager, Will, stopped by to thank us and we chit chatted a bit about the dinner and the yelp event. It was a nice touch. So, thanks yelp and thanks Trace! I will be back!",5.0 star rating
"I was here for an event just a few weeks ago, and received a very generous gift card in which I had to redeem by a certain date so we made reservations for last night. I at first wondered if Friday was the right choice, and realized as soon as we pulled into their valet that it was indeed not. There is a huge event going on at the W this weekend and their lot was completely full. They said we could valet at Bob's across the street but once there they informed us it was for customers only. After we circled we finally found a public lot and somehow managed to snag one of the few remaining spaces. As we walked out we noticed they had put the Lot Full sign up. Thankfully it was a nice night and not a far walk so we didn't mind. Once seated, I couldn't wait for my husband to experience their food because all the nibbles I had at the event were nothing short of amazing. He ordered an old fashioned ($14) and I got a glass of rosé ($11), and we decided to skip dessert and get two appetizers to share instead. Even for a Friday I wouldn't say they were slammed because we had numerous empty tables around us the whole time we were there. Our waitress was very sweet, but service was extremely slow and we were forgotten about most of the night. They have an Easy Tiger bread basket here for $6 that I wanted to try since I know their bakery is a big deal around town, but it's not everyday I get to eat at such swanky places so I went for the seared scallops instead ($16). We also got the selection of fromage ($16) which was blue cheese, a manchego style cheese, and a local buttery cheese served with toasted baguette, tart jam, and sliced dates. The scallops were cooked to perfection, but had a little too strong of a fishy taste. We wondered if maybe they were just a teensy bit past the 'sell by' date. The cotechino sausage on the plate and lentils though were good. The cheese board was also disappointing. I liked both cheeses, but the blue cheese was a doozy. Strongly pungent and overpowering. The tart jam was a nice compliment but neither of us particularly care for dates. We both wished we would have gone for the bread basket instead. My entree was the only plate of the night that I loved and wouldn't change a thing about. I ordered the house made cream agnolotti ($24) with braised oxtail, pecorino, and black pepper. Each bite made my taste buds sing! The pasta was fresh and filled with melted luscious cheese, and the oxtail was cooked beautifully and melted in my mouth with each buttery forkful. It was divine. My husband sadly did not feel the same way. He got the striped bass ($29) that came with chorizo, potato, olive, and orange sabayon. They left the skin on the fish which should have been nice and crispy, but instead was soggy and the entire fish was slimy. He said it did not taste fresh and that some of the frozen filets he buys at HEB and cooks himself taste better. He also ordered a side of hand cut fries ($6) with herbs and sea salt which I kept seeing him eat instead of his meal. For the prices of the food, and especially having the pleasure of tasting some of their small bites recently and being blown away, we expected so much more. I don't know if there was a different chef last night but it felt like I was eating at a totally different place than the one I had gone to before. Even with my gift card, we spent $60 and didn't feel it was worth it by any means. We could have gone to our favorite sushi place for that and eaten like kings. I'm giving them 3 stars even though my experience was a 2, because I know they are capable of better and sadly this wasn't a good night. Again, my entree was lovely and I felt that alone was worth every penny. But if I had come here without my hefty gift card and was expected to pay those prices for the food I received, I would have been much more upset.",3.0 star rating
"Fancy! Fancy! Fancy! I rarely do fancy restaurants. If I do, Trace will be on my list of fancy places to go. Started off with some Pinot Noir (Rodney Strong from Sonoma County, CA). It's a sweet wine which is how I love my red wine. Of course I don't mind some Malbec but I'll drink some Pinot Noir. For appetizer, I had the Broken Arrow Ranch Venison Tartare with Hand Cut Fries. The fries made a great compliment to the tartare. Of course I had the idea of ordering that combination while eating at another restaurant. I was hesitant on the tartare being mixed in with chopped apples. I must say the apples gave the tartare a light taste and altogether it didn't feel heavy. If anything there was more apples than tartare in it. The fries came out good too. The didn't need to serve it in a mason jar and a ketchup in a small dish. But then again, it is a fancy restaurant and that's one way to fancy it up.Next I had the Housemade Cream Agnolotti which was a pasta dish. Somewhat like cheese ravioli but really good and the cream sauce was mixed with braised oxtail. I'm glad they had the right portion for this dish as it was a heavy cream (which is not bad). I do love cream sauces on my pasta dishes but I only like it once in a blue moon. Then for dessert it was the Chocolat Au Lait. When it came out I thought, I didn't want to touch it because it was beautifully put together. Once I did touch it, it was really good. It had right mixture of mousse, milk chocolate almond cake, white chocolate ganache and raspberry gel. I came here on a Monday which wasn't too crowded. The service was great.",4.0 star rating
"We went here for dinner before seeing Willie Nelson live at the Moody Theater. We had an excellent meal to say the least. The service was fabulous, the meal was delicious, and the ambiance was great. Cocktails were interesting and tasty, as were the appetizers (a few of us had a seafood chowder, which was very good). The main courses were incredible - the plating was very cool and the food was delicious; highly recommend the steak! Dessert was equally incredible with incredible plating and taste. The chocolate praline cake was amazing and the Texas corn desert was interesting and unexpectedly delicious.

"Trace, it's been awhile since my last visit and since then you've really stepped up your game!  The dinner menu has been simplified and it is easier to understand the portion sizes.  We enjoyed everything you offered to us this evening!  The bass was so flavorful with a delicate and delicious sauce, and the added interest on the plate (the chorizo sausage and kalamata olives) were yummy tidbits.  The ham and cheddar risotto was creamy and savory, and with the warm poached egg on top it was heavenly.  The roasted kale salad with the black eyed peas was a good size for sharing.  The Easy Tiger bread starter was well worth the modest $5: crusty and delicious bread with a generous portion of three whipped butters (my favorite was the chickpea spread).  The service you provide is definitely worthy of your status as a partner with the W Hotel chain.  Our server provided flawless execution of our meal and every need was met.  Your bartender extraordinaire, Kat, is a true gem with her sparkling personality and ability to cater to my ""off menu"" request without blinking an eye, for my beloved blueberry and basil martini.",4.0 star rating
"They make think of me as one of the most annoying customers of the night but hopefully they let me back because the food was incredible. I originally had a reservation for 3 but a couple hours before, I requested to change it to 7.  When we go to the restaurant, little did I know, the others were going to be joining us.  So rather then continually adding tables and chairs, the Manager, moved us to the sectioned area off in the back where there was a large table to fit our party of 10.We all started with drinks and then were given two cheese and meat plates on the house which were fantastic.  We also ordered the tiger bread with the three different types of spreads.  The bread was very fresh and each spread had a different taste that was better then the last.  We topped off our appetizer course with two bottles of prosecco on the house which was a perfect way to celebrate the first course.  On to the main course.  I ordered the pork dish which came with three different cuts including pork loin, sausage and a cut off of a bone.  All three were great but the final cut off of a bone was by far the best and most delicious.  The whole dish was topped off with crispy toast and beans. I also tried the Quail and Dumplings which according to my friend, was ""the best Quail she has ever had.""  The sweet potato dumplings were a perfect combination with the quail.Overall, the meal was great, service was great, and the night was great.  When ever I'm in the mood for a fancy get away dinner, I know where I will go.",5.0 star rating
"Ahhh the W, I feel like I'm in LA again :) Cute set up, great service, food was alright.B: Lamb - it's okay, could use more flavoring, texture was softA: Steak - a little tough but seasoning was greatC: Potato and cheese soup - a bit runny, I was hoping for more creamier texture, slice of cheese was thin.B: Collard greens - I don't know why I ordered this!

"I stopped in here last night before my event.  I had heard they had happy hour from 5-7pm, which was true!  I ordered the champagne mojito and the fiance got the jalapeno cucumber drink.  They were both delicious and a good way to start off our fantastic night.  Outside of happy hour the drinks are pricey.  If you hit them up during happy hour it was $7 a drink - not bad for fancy in my opinion!  We sat at the bar just long enough to drink our drink pay our tab and then we were on our way.  They do offer some small bites during happy hour as well.  You can dine in their beautiful dining room which I briefly got a glimpse of.  I look forward to going back int he future to try some of their food.",4.0 star rating
"Trace has really great food and is surprisingly affordable. Great brunch spot if you have a big group in town. If you are looking for cheap mimosa deals on the weekend, this is your place! $1 mimosas or $5 carafes. Only negative is that if you do have a large party, they will not do split checks and will only take up to 4 credit cards so make sure one person in your party is okay with putting their card down if you do plan on bringing a large party here!",4.0 star rating

My friends have bought the food and juice and they say its awesome.Some of the employees seem a little on edge so I try to tread lightly, smile and be extra nice. After all, they're making my drink!

Friendly, smiling, having fun at work - makes me want to quit my downtown job and go work at a juice bar.

"We've gotten back into the routine of stopping by Trace this summer and it's gone really well. The location is great and the setting is as visually appealing as is the food. I appreciate food that is as much fun to look at as it is to eat. Trace definitely delivers in both the visual and taste department. Those elements combined with the exceptional care and attention provided by the staff keep us coming back. I should also mention it's an incredible value. The Happy Hour menu (5-7 every day including weekends) is a bargain. Tito's cocktails are just $5 and there are many great food offerings with special HH pricing. The summer dinner program allows three levels of dining starting at just $25 for two courses, $35 for three and $45 gets you three courses and a glass of wine. We've enjoyed a large sampling from both the HH menu and regular menu and not once did we feel any regret or remorse. Many members of the staff have taken time from their schedule to ensure we were taken care of. Ashley, Will, Nadine, Angel and Zane have all made us feel genuinely welcomed and comfortable.Located at the W Hotel next to ACL Live-Moody Theater, Trace is a welcome Oasis on a hot summer afternoon. You should stop by and give it the a try. It's fancy without being pretentious, service is attentive and friendly.",5.0 star rating
"Plates are fussy and rather small, considering price and being billed as mains.  Just be aware that when you order something like say chicken, it'll be a few small slices neatly arranged on a little pile of veggies.  So long as you know what to expect you'll be fine, the flavors of the dishes we've tried have been very good. Having said that, I'd recommend the lamb as a more filling course.  Otherwise add the bread, and/or the mac and cheese with burnt ends to fill out the meal.  Half shell oysters fresh and appealingly plated.  Dessert? Apple cinnamon beignets will leave you happy.  No draft beer, which always makes me sad.  The by the glass wine selection is not large, but has some nice choices.  Excellent space, and if you are headed to ACL/Moody, it could not possibly be any more convenient.  Found service to be friendly, prompt, efficient, excellent job of timing the meal so it was no stress in the short time we had before a show.  Outside bar seating looks awesome.",4.0 star rating

I was also very excited to know that the Chef had also entered into CHOPPED a few days prior our arrival at the restaurant.  Not only was presentation of the food picture-esk, but each course I had, was incredibly tasty!good to see, that others reviews feel the same!GREAT JOB TRACE!",5.0 star rating
I've been to Trace three times now -- two private events and once for brunch.Their brunch is absolutely worth going downtown for.  Boozy drinks are only $3 and they're not chintzy either. Legit Bloody Mary's!  Not the best I've ever had but definitely respectable and the price is right. Best part -- your first drink is included with your meal!Their outdoor patio seating is pretty tranquil and relaxing.  It will make you forget you're in the city.For food: The Eggs Benedict was very good. The migas plate was just okay -- failed attempt to fancy up something that was fine as is. Highlight: The bacon was super tasty.  I don't know if it was a fluke or not but I got a side of bacon WHICH RUINED ME for two whole weeks. A side came with six slices of thick meaty bacon pieces perfectly cooked. Strange how you can focus on one thing but it was seriously that good.,5.0 star rating
"Went to Trace for Christmas dinner - a mixed affair. We had reservations and were seated immediately. It was not busy. Our waiter was very cordial and never broke his pleasantness. For me, though, atmosphere is EVERYTHING. The restaurant seemed to have an identity crises, not quite a restaurant, not quite a bar, maybe a bit too fancified for breakfast and lunch but not chic enough for dinner. The lighting was terrible, not far off from the feel of an airport diner. And the speed with which our food came out it was if they were afraid we'd miss our flight. Three course meal in one hour. Pacing could've allowed for leisurely meal. The food itself was pretty good. The chestnut-lentil soup was ""to die for,"" and the arugula salad very good. My guest and I had the prime rib for entrees which was served with what was billed as a horseradish sauce if memory serves correct. Not much bite to it but the meat was fine. Deserts were terrible - inedible, if truth be told - and I'm NEVER one to turn down desert. All told, for $60/person and extra cost for bread and drinks, we had a $200 meal that wasn't quite worth the price. Don't know if we'll return.",3.0 star rating

"What a dining experience! The food was top-notch and the service was well-trained. They even start off with an introduction of their mission statement as a restaurant and why they have their name. Well played... It is definitely a fancy-smancy place (located in a hotel). The ambiance of the restaurant was modern, trendy, but they also have a lounge that looks pretty spiffy, too. Nice decorations and trees wrapped in Christmas lights to look out to. The waitress was well-mannered and well-rehearsed. Great recommendations and very accommodating. They close at 10pm, but even then they didn't rush us out for staying late! The real deal stuff: foodPerfect. The seasoning had complementing, exquisite flavors. The presentation was noteworthy. Good amount for a perfect dinner. The combination of textures and taste was meticulously thought-out. - We ordered the scallops to start. Very pricey ($16) but also very impressive taste. Interesting to have grapefruit on top, but it worked well with the salty flavor- I got the redfish per recommendation. WOW. No idea what benne was, but the crunch and unique flavor of sesame was incredible with the fish! Needless to say, my plate was clean afterwards. - My friend (food connoisseur) got the lamb. Unique to serve it two different ways in the same dish, but it was oh so tender and delectable! That dish had a variety of flavors to play with. - Sorbet for dessert: passion fruit. Another WOW. Strong but beautiful flavor. That was the cherry on top! (Just kidding, it had raspberries on top, but still)Pinky high fancy, but close-your-eyes-and-dream-about-it good. This is what I'd imagine a Michelin-star restaurant to be like...",5.0 star rating

"Intrigued with the food offerings at a recent event at Trace, I returned to try out more of their menu.  Of course, my $100 Yelp gift card made that decision easy.From the get go, Trace's staff was outstanding.  Everything from my phone reservation to the lunch service was taken care of with pleasant and professional attitudes.  The food was delicious for the most part, but every dish seemed inconsistent.  Two in our party ordered the goat vindaloo curry. Although this was due to personal taste, one of them (a vindaloo lover) did not enjoy the chef's interpretation of this dish; portions were also quite small.  Another ordered the mussels with chorizo.  It was delicious!  Strangely, nothing accompanied this dish and we had to ask for bread with which to mop up its lovely broth.  One of the staff took the initative and brought out some french fries to go with the mussels, telling us she thought it would go perfectly.  (See what I mean about the service?)  The steak in my steak frites entree was cooked and seasoned perfectly; however, my frites were unfortunately extremely oversalted.  I could not eat them and finally had to ask for a portion with less salt.We indulged in desserts and coffee afterwards.  The carrot cake praline was my runaway favourite.  I could have easily eaten three more helpings of it!  Their rich, dark coffee was also very good.  It wasn't served at a hot enough temperature for me, though.  After adding cream, I was basically drinking tepid coffee.  I know my excellent server would have immediately made a fresh batch, but at that point I did not want any more fuss, and we also had to leave shortly.For such an upscale venue that prides itself on only the best local ingredients, I certainly expected more from Trace's kitchen.  However, the staff blew me away with their top notch service, and I'll bump up the rating for that alone.",4.0 star rating

I actually had a decent experience. I wouldn't describe my steak as mind blowing but it was good. It helps when you order it medium. My theory is that when you order a steak well done you might as well get a chew toy and puts lots of A1 Steak Sauce. Luckily I didn't  have to resort to that. I would describe Texas Land and Cattle as a place to go if you can't afford to go to the Vince Young Steakhouse. So I went here after ACL. It was an hour before they were about to close but they still served good food. As the card suggested we decided to take advantage of the one appetizer and two entrees for $25. We started off with the onion strings which were not soggy. Then we had the 6 oz steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It was good and our waiter was good about getting our free refills. I thought that I was going to be bursting with lemonade the way I was drinking. I know this is a food chain but I must say it they put out a good meal.,3.0 star rating

As the food came out in random order a side her a steak for this person as  the waiter confused and not organized at all asked everyone over and over what we ordered and with what side.

"I lived about 10 minutes away from a Texas Land and Cattle while actually living in Texas and was never really tempted to go in.Recently, on a business trip to Austin, I went out to dinner with a group of co-workers and this restaurant was chosen.The food was good, I had the filet topped with bleu cheese and was surprised. It was very flavorful and cooked a perfect medium rare. The side mushrooms and grilled onions were good, but I hardly touched them because I was full from the steak and the bread. They also had some wines by the bottle on sale and I was forced to get one and pretty much drink it by myself because no one else in my party drank. (Note how upset I am by this, not)  The service was good, but unorganized and lacking in some areas. I wouldn't say it was the server's fault, more like management not having enough staff or bus boy/girl to assist the servers.We ordered dessert to go and they were out of what I had ordered and I only found out when they brought the dessert for the other people in my party.

"Why do so many people eat here? We do not understand.We had a gift card and came a bit after lunch. The waiter was professional. The food was mediocre. My wife's steak was a smoked sirloin where they used liquid smoke, which upset her stomach. About a third of the small steak could not be eaten because it could not be cut because of poor quality meat which had membranes. This is  supposed to be quality meat, especially for the high price and small portions. $12.99 for six ounces. After the third plate of the steak being brought, it was finally able to be eaten. It is still bothering her even after eight hours and she did not eat that much there. I was not happy with my small portion of the sirloin. The manager was helpful but really did not have quality meat to serve my wife. He decided to not charge my wife for her meal. My French fries were over cooked and tasted worse that what I can get in the frozen food section of the grocery and cook myself. The quality of the fries was as bad as the quality of the worse fries you can buy in the lowest quality fast food joint. Onion rings came with the meat and they were salty beyond belief.I am glad that I used up my certificate, as I will not need to return to this restaurant. My wife and I have much experience in dining in restaurants around the country and willl not return here even though it is down the same street that we live.The food quality is a solid one star. I must give the staff and manager a little credit because they showed care for us.  That is why I have rated them two stars.",2.0 star rating

Luckily there was a deal for two entrees and an appetizer for $25 so my brother and I snagged that one to save on money.Our appetizer of choice was the plate of onion strings. There were a LOT of onion strings, and they were well-crisped. I don't like it when onion strings or onion rings are heavily battered but these weren't. To start, the tables also got delicious bread with butter and cinnamon butter to dip. Great stuff.Entrees come with soup or salad and a side of choice. My soup came out first, and it was a cup of French onion soup. Yes, I had onions right after onions. It was actually very good. Usually French onion soups that I have are very salty but this one was a good mix of saltiness and savoriness. The cheese on top was still hot and melty, and the bread underneath was a nice combination of crunch and soft. That was awesome since the bread pieces are usually soggy whenever I get French onion soup at other places; it was a definite sign that they had made it shortly before serving it.Then my medium rare 8 oz. smoked sirloin came out with garlic mashed potatoes. Oh my. It was cooked to the right temperature, and the smokiness of the beef was delicious. The beef was tender and oh so flavorful. I loved the pepper-crusted edges too. Though it looked small on the plate, its richness (and all the other food) had me nearly bursting. I can't remember the last time I had such a delectable steak. Fantastic place. I wish I could go again!",5.0 star rating
"I had the cheeseburger and fries during peak evening hours. The burger was cooked to my satisfaction, and brought out at the correct temperature. I was not a fan of the small shoestring fries, seemed like work to eat them. Fries were also a little salty and not hot enough when served. The two bartenders, Chris & Chris, were attentive until distracted by taking phone in orders. I believe bartenders should not take phone in orders, needs to be handled elsewhere.",3.0 star rating

"I was just in this place literally 15 minutes agoI have to say, the service wasn't that great. Many places I have been lately have had really bad service...and these companies should really start retraining people. Our waitress according to the receipt was Hollis and she served my party on table 41. First: we needed a high chair and was told they didn't have any and had to wait to get one when  another child left the restaurant. Later, the Manager came over and said he was sorry for the inconvenience and brought us one. So he did good. Then the waitress took our drink order and came with drinks but forgot the child drink and after she delivered the drinks quickly took our order and disappeared for a solid 20 minutes. Someone brought our soup/salads and she never came to check on them to make sure they were correct. Later when the main course came, she delivered it; dropped it off and said enjoy. She walked away so fast, I had to wave down another waitress to bring us steak sauce. She never checked to see if our food was cooked properly or even tasted good and one of the steaks was over cooked and was suitable. Again, I waved down the manager to bring us to-go boxes and ask if we could get some water for the table since we never were asked if we needed additional drinks or re-fills. We placed a to-go order as well, and that took longer to get than our own food. All in all the service was not good and I have had much better experiences other places. Given this experience, I will opt to go to Longhorn Steakhouse rather than TX Land and Cattle.",2.0 star rating
"There was nothing special about our meal here.  I had the ribeye (medium rare) with a baked potato and a wedge salad.  We also had the jalapeno appetizer.  The appetizer was poor, the salad was ok, steak was average and the baked potato was really good but then shouldn't it always be really good?   The service was good but the place was 3/4 empty so that should be expected.",2.0 star rating

1 stars is about all you should ever get if you can't do a rear stake.

"After walking for hours in the summer heat around beautiful downtown Austin, Texas I was thirsty and I wanted more than just water. This is when I happened to walk by Daily Juice and I am so glad I went inside! From the instant you walk into the place you smell fresh fruits and see veggies and bright produce on ice ready to be devoured. This is a great place for any health conscious or thirsty person or anyone that likes smoothies! I got the ""Marigold"" which was a combination of mango, peach, and oranges.TASTE was amazing!! (and it was all pure fruit, no additives, colors, or flavors, or sugars!)PRICE was a little more than I expected, but not bad for the quality and size of the drinksSERVICE was patient and helpful since I was new and took a while to look at the menu and decide what I wanted",5.0 star rating
"I LOVE DAILY JUICE :)I recently started going to this little gem in the 2nd Street District, and every time I leave this place I definitely feel like I am doing my body good. Plus, the location is super convenient, the staff is extremely nice, and the shop is very clean and runs in a very organized manner. Plus, if you don't live or work downtown, they will validate your parking for up to 2 hours.  It's January, so time to get my butt in gear and back to clean-eating (or shall I say ""clean-drinking""!) This location does have a few food items to choose from, mainly Kale Salads, which I have not had a chance to try quite yet. But I have had a chance to try a few of their smoothies and juices:* Subliminator Smoothie - A peanut butter & jelly sandwich in smoothie form. Ummmm yummm in my tum!* Thai Curious - a vacation in my mouth. But for real y'all, this juice is heavenly.* Pineapple Popeye - ""I'm strong to the finish, 'cause I eats me Spinach, I'm Popeye the sailor man! (toot, toot)"" This is one of my favorite juices for sure!Pricing is a bit expensive, but if you live or work in the neighborhood, you get a small discount on your order. I understand juicing at home can be expensive as well, produce doesn't come cheap. But I will definitely be going back to Daily Juice to try out some more of their cold-pressed goodness because of the convenience.",4.0 star rating

"Recently I took a weekend trip to Austin, TX to visit a friend. We went out to eat, explored downtown Austin, and, eventually, ended up at Daily Juice. Being from Southern California, and living in a very health-conscious area, I've experienced a fair share of juice bars so I set the bar pretty high. So I walked into Daily Juice and was really surprised at how cute it was! It's a bright, clean space that's comfortable to be in. Upon entering, all the employees greeted me right away, which is a HUGE plus! Customer service is really important to me and these guys nailed it! The juice was awesome; I love the pledge to be organic and fresh and local. It reminded me of a few places back home.

So many healthy options that are actually appealing!! The simply balanced cold pressed juice was awesome! I'm not a big kale fan but you could hardly taste it! We need one of these in Dallas!

"Two words - Longhorn Roll.  Hands down my favorite roll...ever...in the world. I used to live a block away from this place and it quickly became my favorite afternoon snack/dinner spot.  The ambiance is really nice and what you would expect from a sushi bar.  It isn't too loud and I actually even studied there (except on weekend nights when they have karaoke).  The sushi is GREAT and the presentation is even better.  The service is always nice, but I especially like sitting at the sushi bar because the guys that make the rolls are pretty dang cool and will talk to you the entire time.  Prices are a littleeee steep which is why I knocked off a star (as a college student I spent wayyy too much of my money there) but they have really great happy hour and reverse happy hour prices, and come on...who doesn't love REVERSE HAPPY HOUR?!  I know I do!Overall - if you're into sushi, this is a great spot :)",4.0 star rating
"let me start by saying that i dig a restaurant with a dope dj. love great music when i'm eating. however, dj ""spin"" (clever, isn't it?) is better suited to play at a jr high school kid's birthday party than a restaurant. I was half expecting him to play ""barbie girl"" or some remix of daughtry. he is not innovative enough as a dj and he does not know how to set the mood for a restaurant.and thats the problem, this restaurant could have such a better vibe. the food is ok, not brilliant, but good enough to come from time to time. I ordered the hi five roll, spider roll, uni, sake, and hamachi. the sake and hamachi were ok, the uni was not great, and the pieces from the rolls were inconsistent. some huge some perfect. I was told they get uni delivered daily, but i would have never guessed it from what was served. the soft she'll crab was a bit like plastic and the sauce a bit Karo syrupy. the garlic edamame was great, though. it is a bit overpriced for the quality of what you're getting, but may come back...when the dj isn't cramming crap remixes into my ears.",3.0 star rating
"Their fish is flown in from Alaska every 3 days. Their rolls are fresh, made quickly and with adept hands. Their spicy chipotle mayo sauce is yummy :) I think their menu is extensive and between a sushi aficionado, an intermediate, and a child, everyone will easily be able to get exactly what they want. On the appetizer menu, we had the fried gulf oysters. Just know: You will be able to taste the signature flavor of gulf salt & brine even under their fried breading. They were well-cooked and served with a delicious dipping sauce, but I'll probably go for something less emphatic next time as a starter. For the kiddos, there is a great breaded chicken appetizer (name and spelling escape me) but it's a perfect portion and we added a side of wedge potatoes which, oddly enough, I have to say were delicious and perfectly cooked and downright remarkable. I commented more than once that we'd come to a sushi restaurant, and here I am impressed by their french fries. But don't let that detract from the fact that their sushi honestly is very good. In their rolls, one of the most important observations I made was that they do not skimp on fish portions by any means. Each bite had a fish in it proportionate to the other ingredients by half - So we in no way felt jipped for the price. A $100 meal got us four different rolls, some sashimi bites, wine, beer, two appetizers (kiddo's and the oysters) and a side of fries. To top it all off, we got to spend a good amount of time at the end of our meal chatting with and getting to know the owner. The atmosphere is intimate yet fun and they have a full and extensive bar separate from the dining room. They also have private / event dining available. This is definitely on my list of ""favorite"" sushi in Austin. Now to check out their reverse happy hour!",4.0 star rating

"This place is kind of far out, but was still absolutely HOPPING at a later-night seating (around 9pm). It was also incredibly loud, like eating sushi in a nightclub blasting house music. Not my favorite for atmosphere. And it was absolutely packed with . . . a younger crowd. My guess is folks come here for . . . that. Because it's probably not for the food, or at least not the sushi.We tried 4 different rolls, and the hake collar, which was ok, if a bit salty. We also wasted our time on a ridiculous tiramisu dessert, simply because our Groupon came with a dessert. Just . . . why?I'll cover the rolls individually:The best was the Obake. I could actually taste the fish in it, and the flavors meshed pretty well. The Big Easy and Crouching Tiger sounded good, but the fish was lost in the complication of the roll. The biggest offense, however, was the house special Umi Roll. It's almost like they pureed a bunch of fish into a mush and wrapped it in a vegetable. It was nearly inedible. Overall - if you want to have mediocre, fairly pricey rolls in a nightclub atmosphere, or if you're nearby and nothing else is open that late, go on in. But don't make a special trip or anything.",2.0 star rating

"Decided to try Umi before a movie tonight and was fairly disappointed.   I took my two teenagers as it's something we do when Mama is out of town as she isn't a fan of sushi.  For three of us, dinner ran $125 with no alcohol.  We ordered a boat for three, plus a longhorn roll and order of Unagi.The disappointment started when I asked the waitress to provide my son the mushroom soup instead of Miso as he didn't care for Miso.  In a less than helpful way she explained they had a no substitution policy.  I explained that is a poor policy to which she replied that she doesn't make the rules.   Now both soups are the same price on the menu and should be a simple option to accommodate their guests.Next, the longhorn roll came out and sat on the table getting cold while we waited almost 10 minutes for plates after I had to remind the waitress our need of plates.   Then the boat came.  The fish was fresh and well cut.   However all of the sushi had a large ball of wasabi applied to the rice that was too strong, over powering the flavor of the fish.  Most of it was best, peeling the fish off and eating it as sashimi.Overall disappointing and could have been resolved by being more accommodating to customer needs and not applying so much wasabi and allowing the customer to add the wasabi to taste.",2.0 star rating

"From the entrance, this place is horribly managed or just under staffed.  We had to wait for a hostess to seat us.  Everything took longer and longer after that. We sat and got our waters fairy quickly.  We ordered drinks immediately and they took forever.  The Margarita were small proportioned for$12.  The place is over priced.  Quality was 4/5.  The beer was $6.  About 10-15 after that we received our drinks and ordered our appetizers and main sushi dish.  We ordered miso and three sushi rolls.  Our first sushi roll arrived 15 minutes after drinks. The miso soup took 20 minutes to arrive! Our waitress was working  over 5 tables and the bar so she forgot.   The next two rolls came  out 30 minutes after our drinks.  Sushi quality was horrendous 2/5.  The top of the sushi looked good, but it was deceiving.  I turned over the sushi and saw it was packed full of rice and the smallest piece of fish I've ever seen.  Overall bad presentation and over priced.  Not good for drinks or food.  Needs new owner or management.",1.0 star rating
"This was my second time to Umi Sushi and both experiences were quite pleasant! On both occasions I went on a rainy afternoon.. Yesterday we were literally the only table in the restaurant, making it a little too peaceful.. But the ambiance and decor of the restaurant is nice and inviting. We devoured the spicy edamame for starters.. And then decided to get the Umi Special Roll.. For $18 it was pretty disappointing (I told my boyfriend we should have gone with the Hot Mama roll- which is amazing and you should definitely try if you go) we also had the tiger roll and hot roll which were both good.

"Dude, that's some good sushi!The girlfriend and I decided to eat lunch here based off a past pleasant experience, a couple of years ago. The staff there was very laid back but professional at the same time. Our waiter made sure we were taken care of and gave us an ETA on our order without us even asking. The atmosphere was very relaxing and calm. However, I will be back to check out this reverse happy hour I keep reading about in other reviews. Apparently the atmosphere changes during this time.  The sushi in on word, ""Fantastic"". We ordered: 2 Crispy Spicy Shrimp Hand rolls 1 Hot Roll1 Shaggy Dog Roll 1 Lady Bug Roll. The hand rolls were damn good. I almost ordered 2 more but I realized I had 3 rolls unattended. Hot Roll - First let me say you MUST try this roll at least once. It was my girls favorite. I generally eat sushi to get away from eating anything fried but, this is was an exception. Get this roll. It should be renamed ""HOT DIGGITY DAMN ROLL"". 10/10Shaggy Dog Roll - Anytime this is on the menu at a sushi bar, we order it. I've had better versions of this roll, but by no means does that mean it wasn't good. I'll still order it the next time I go. 8/10Lady Bug Roll - I never had this but the combination of ingredients in it intrigued me enough to take a gamble, and I love trying new things. I don't know how to explain the taste of this roll. It was definitely delicious but odd lol. In a good way! When I ate it I could immediately taste the spicy snow crab, cream cheese, cucumber and eel sauce. However, once the layered strawberry hit the taste buds I was just thrown for a loop. Kind of like a plot twist at the end of a good movie. I probably wouldn't order it again but only because I'd want to give another roll a shot. 9/10Great experience and great food.",4.0 star rating

The beignets were okay, and I felt it was strange that it was served in a cone fry container. My chicken and waffles were well worth it along with $2 mimosas!!",4.0 star rating

"We came here for lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. Food was mediocre at best.What really stood out was the waitress' service or lack thereof. She was pretty lackadaisical in her service and not attentive. Several times, other waiters had to point out that we were asking for something. They brought over 1 foccacia and as it was pretty good, we ordered another. She put the order in and we were almost done with lunch before it came out. In other restaurants I have been in, if something is being added to your bill, they let you know. This being an Italian restaurant, bread seems pretty standard. When we ordered the foccacia, no mention was made of there being an extra charge. When we got the bill, $6 was added. We questioned and received an ""oh, well"" followed by an insincere sorry. Not to mention the price of  it is only $5.50 (per the menu) and she charged us $6. I know its only .50 cents but it just adds insult to injury. I am not impressed by the food or service here. While I would have potentially returned because its conveniently located near my office, the sub-par service makes me think again.",2.0 star rating
"I've been going to this location since it opened, and I go for three reasons: experience, location, consistency. Well, I go for a fourth reason: B R U N C H. Austin's most important meal. Pros: consistent food, consistently friendly service, consistently clean, great coffee, vegetarian options, bottomless mimosas, dog-friendly patio, tons of parking available in the area, and you can walk/wobble to tons of Sunday Funday hotspots. The food is good, too, but I am not sure that the food is better than the atmosphere, the friendliness, the location, and finally the total experience. Cons: if you don't like to get there before the rush you might find the long wait a con. If you're vegan, you basically have one dish to eat that you can count on (pasta with tomato basil). I mean really I've been going there for a very long time so those two cons are obviously overlooked. Cheers!",5.0 star rating
"My original review is below. My first visit was amazing. Since then I've been back three times, each time progressively getting worse. Horrible service to the point of being forgotten the last time we were there. Bad oysters and incorrectly cooked risotto. Not going back.'This place is a solid 5 stars. For those thinking this place is overpriced. You are INSANE! The food is amazing, and the price point is spot on or cheaper than restaurants not even half this caliber!

"Dropped by during the dinner rush on a Friday night and they were still able to seat us immediately on the patio. I've seen some reviews criticizing the service, but we didn't have any complaints. Food was brought out quickly and we breezed through the meal. I highly recommend the Fettuccine Frutti di Mare. I was initially hesitant when I saw the pasta had a brownish sauce instead of white (I'd been imagining it would be an alfredo), but it was incredibly tasty! First time eating scallops and they were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Would definitely come back again.",5.0 star rating
"Our last experience an year ago at Taverna was excellent, so we decided to come back for a second time!  Reservations and the long walk down to 2nd street was made.  We both tried different dishes this time around but sadly they didn't live up to the high expectations.Let's start with the good.  For appetizers we ordered the Taverna Foccacia.  This was just absolutely delicious.  If individual dishes could be rated, this would be five stars easy.  The portion size was huge and can be easily shared among three people.  All the ingredients came together really nicely and every inch was devoured.  I really enjoyed the cheese and mushroom combo in particular.  When we first gazed upon its size, we thought we would be taking some home.  But after the first couple bites, we knew it was going to be finished.  I strongly recommend this appetizer and would love to get it again.Now the not-so-good.  We both shared the Risotto al Parmigiano con Salsa Tartufata and the Veal Marsala.  I wasn't a fan of the texture of the risotto and the dish as a whole was thick and not very interesting.  The veal wasn't as tender as I was expecting and the sauce completely saturated the veal and my taste buds.  After several bites, I just got bored and tired of the taste and of its heaviness.Service was still excellent and with so many good-looking dishes in their menu, this won't completely deter me from coming back.  This night was a 3/5, but combined with my first experience, the average is a solid 4 stars.",4.0 star rating

I never thought I would be one to order chicken and waffles, but this is now all I order here. A delicious mango salsa comes on the side that goes TOO perfectly with the dish! Must try!

Would not be so bad if the food was good, right. OMG, how does this place stay in business???? Are you kidding me? It is sooooo  bad. bruschetta-dry, nasty, no flavor.....took an hour to arrive after we ordered....no joke!potstickers-just like another reviewer wrote, frozen would be better. So nasty.Brussels sprouts salad- oh, sooo bad, small, bitter, so gross.Tomato soup- tasted exactly like marinara sauce! Fondue- well after it arrives 40 minutes after we order, the chocolate fondue was greasy, broken, chunky, I honestly cannot believe that a restaurant would ever serve something so visually unappealing.  This place truly blew my mind and not in a good way. Also, it was so NOT busy for a Saturday night.  Therefore no excuse for how long it took. I am a Yelp junkie. I would never write a review that was not wholly honest. This place is bad.

"I just can't get into this place.I blame the positive reviews on the, ""if it seems fancy and I spent a butt-load of money on it, so I must love it"" logic.  Which means their branding works for most, just not me.I've been here a few times and each time I loathe it more and more.  The food is ok, just ok... And we've been through the menu from entrees to apps... Just nothing wowing.  The staff aren't all that great.  In over half of our visits, they've seemed overwhelmed and thus not so attentive to tables.  And the pricing although fair, just doesn't work with that combo.The location is ok, but I'd honestly rather save my money and get a meal at Jo's which is nearby rather than toss it here.When you're in Austin and have options like Vino Vino or Wink or Olive & June or...you name it...the list goes on and on, this place's flaws become increasingly more evident and it just doesn't measure up.  If we were in a town like Kansas City, this place would be a top 10 spot.",2.0 star rating
Dined here a few week ago. Service was great! We had calamari which was a bit salty. Mushroom pizza was good and the best was my capressi salad which was absolutely delish.

"I don't pretend to be a wine connoisseur. Even living 15 years just south of Napa Valley couldn't instill wine love into me. But I know what tastes good, and I know what I like, and Cru Wine Bar on 2nd Street has a good mix of both of those things.I won't go into the expanse of the wine list; and why would you want me to if you just read what I said? But it is pretty expansive, and my friends who are far more wine sophisticated than I am absolutely love it when I bring them in. On the food side, it's downright tasty. I love the cheese and charcuterie selection, the fondue (healthy living be damned), the pizzas (again, healthy living), the lobster and shrimp potstickers, the filet, and a smattering of other tasty things. I will say that if you order the Caprese salad, you need to state that you want it cold. Don't get me started, but trust me, it's delicious if you special order it... as it should be.Service is quick, knowledgable, friendly, and even non-locals feel like locals. The managers run a tight ship. Sure, some reviews indicate service complaints but show me a restaurant that doesn't have an off night and I'll show you a unicorn playing a banjo on a space station. I do love the ambiance and mostly enjoy sitting at the bar to overhear the chatter of others, but the table sections are awfully nice, too.Outside patio is cool, unless it is summer, and then it is hot. See what I did there? I am constantly baffled by the people drinking rich red wines outside in the middle of 105-degree heat, but maybe it's a ""hot wine"" thing like ""hot yoga."" I just don't know. But they seem fine and no one melts. When it's colder they bring out heaters (I felt the need to say this given all of my temperature judgment). I also don't think people sitting outside in the cold drinking chilled white wine make sense. See, I can be fair. A small faction of the clientele is, as my best friend might say, ""feh."" You get some of the downtown party crowd, some who live around here and some who stumble in. Just hold onto your seats until they trickle off to dirty 6th street and you'll be just fine. And honestly, you're fine anyway, just not what you'd expect in a wine bar. #keepaustinweirdAll in all, Cru is a great place to relax, have some great wine (inside or outside, chilled or otherwise), good eats, and fun chatter.",5.0 star rating

"I've been coming to this Cru for years. It's definitely one of my neighborhood favorites, that's why I keep coming back! They've got a great patio in the middle of downtown.... all the little string lights make the atmosphere pretty charming, and on a night with a gentle breeze, this place is the best. I love coming in for a flight of wine and ordering a bunch of their apps. I do think some of their main entrees are a little over priced, but they are good.Some of my favorites include:Goat Cheese Beignets - these are seriously scrumptiousGrilled Cheese and Tomato Basil Soup - a comfort food faveLamb Lollipops - delish!Charcuterie Board - lots to choose from, and all very goodRoasted Golden Beets - I'm definitely a beets girlPear & Gorgonzola Pizza - the flavors are fab!Chicken Piccata - one of the best I've ever hadThe Wine Flights all have great names that make you want to ""judge the book by it's cover.""

Ordered the cheese fondu (favorite thing) lobster and shrimp potstickers, caprese salad and a pizza. Also tried the sexy red, backpacking through Italy (favorite) and the rosé flights. Although I was a bit disappointed with the Sexy Reds flight, I am willing to keep trying other options! Only thing is I wish we had a more personable experience with our waiter, we never even got his name or an overview of some good options, and we came around 9 so it was slightly dying down.

Then flights of different wines that change often (not the same menu every week after week).

"We came here to grab dinner before a show at the ACL Moody Theater.  Cru is typically our stop as they don't normally have a wait.  We were seated and waited a bit before our waiter finally arrived.  We ordered our food and drinks.....then waited for a while before one app came and then more time passed with no waiter in sight to check on us or inform us that our food is delayed.  My husband went to find the waiter to let him know we had a show. A few minutes later the waiter comes by to say it was taking a while (at this point we had waited about an hour) for our food because of the large party in the restaurant.  FYI - the restaurant was half full so not sure how the kitchen was that slammed.  A few minutes later, a manager (we believe), casually said ""Not going to lie, there was a mixed up in the kitchen"" We know you have a show so we comped your app and cancelled your food."".  I think all of our mouths were left open after the remark.  So they comped our fondue (that's all the food we had) and cancelled our food without trying to make it right.  We were starving and there was no apology or anything.  It was like we were broken up with and left to find our way home.  Very awkward and weird.  I have worked in a restaurant and was a manager so the right thing to do was offer something that was fast (I mean we just order pizza) to fill us up vs. shoo us off starving.  I'll never return.  That is just very poor and unacceptable.",1.0 star rating
The wine flights are excellent but the service was not great. I sat at the bar for brunch and ordered the shrimp hash. It took over thirty minutes to get and was cold when it finally came out. My boyfriend didn't order anything so it took that long for one dish. The restaurant was not packed.

"I have this feeling that people are reluctant to give a chain restaurant more than 3 stars, even if they find it up to snuff. No your steak will rival that of Fleming's, but it will be pretty damn good for the price.My boyfriend hadn't really indulged in steak much before (I KNOW, RIGHT), so Texas Land & Cattle seemed like a great place to start anew. He tried the New York strip (recommended by the waiter) and I decided to try their mesquite grilled quail. Both came out excellent although I found the quail a bit greasy.Alright, enough with the formalities. I've eaten at TXLC for years - my family loves it. They add new local stuff to their menu frequently, although after some time it gets taken away. You can order a ton of food here and not spend a lot.

"Well, that was awkward. A group of us went to this restaurant during our lunch today. Overall, the food was decent. The steak was slightly tough, but well seasoned. I particularly enjoyed their chicken tortilla soup, and their sweet potato was well done. I felt that the food wasn't the best in the world, but it wasn't awful.The awkward moment came when we were just about done with our lunch, my friend lifted her cup off the table to find a cockroach waiting underneath. It rolled over, and started scampering over the table. I jumped up, my friend scrunched into her corner hoping that the cockroach doesn't wander to her, while the waitress hastily tried to get the cockroach. It escaped.The staff's attitude was commendable, the manager did not hesitate to apologize and she quickly told us the meals were covered, and we wouldn't have to pay. She also gave us a ""free meal"" card. I gave this restaurant three stars instead of two because of the staff's attempt to repair the problem and the food was decent.

"My husband and I chose this for my birthday dinner back in April. We've been to TXLC before, and figured that its not a bad choice. The last time we went was before they revamped the menu, but whatever we still figured it was good food. We arrived here at 6:30pm, and somehow didn't leave until almost 9:30, on a Wednesday. We were seated immediately, when we informed the waitress that it was my birthday all she had said was ""oh well, good for you. Happy Birthday, then"". I thought she was just having a crappy day, but still whatever. The waitress took our drink order, brought us our drinks(alcohol), took our questions about some of the orders, took our order and left. I would understand that if it was busy that they'd be having a hard time keeping up. But they were overstaffed, so I just don't understand. My husband and I both finished our drinks before our salads were brought out. We waited a good 20 minutes before we even received our salad with bread. The bread was as HARD AS A ROCK, I'm sure I could of hurt someone with it. We couldn't really cut into it, we just tore off what we could get. Salads came out, we both had the world's smallest dab of ranch on a salad that looked like it was sitting out a while. The leaves were a bit yellow. Still no refills on our drinks. We waited another 30-40 minutes before our steaks were brought out, which were brought out by some other gentleman, who couldn't bus our salad plates. He also didn't stay to ask if the meat was cooked correctly, my husband also received the wrong side. I cut into my meat and it was almost raw, it was so red, bleeding, and super chewy. My husband's steak was the complete opposite, his had no pink, and it was overcooked. 2 more people came by to tell him ""oh sorry about the side, here you go"" which the first one, brought another wrong side. Finally the manager came out and brought him the right one, but didn't even say 'sorry for the inconvenience', he just set it down and walked away. Still no refills. We hadn't seen our waitress in forever. We sat there for about 20 mins waiting for someone to come bus our table, or see how were were doing. After another 20 mins, the waitress finally brings us refills on our drinks....told us ""We're super busy, we had to get the manager behind the bar, to help out"". When I looked around her in the direction of the bar, I saw the bartender leaning up against the bar watching TV. Seriously? Where did you go too? She finally brought us our check, who would of really pay $14 for drinks per person? Mediocre food, and poor poor service. I loved TXLC before they revamped, too bad they couldn't revamp their service as well. So disappointed. Made for a crappy birthday.",1.0 star rating

"Was in Austin last month for work, and I figured it would be blasphemy to be in Texas and not eat steak, right? So I saw this place not far from where I was staying, and after reading some of the Yelp reviews I figured I would give it a whirl, not knowing that this was a chain restaurant.After taking forever to ponder the menu, I finally decided on the Peppercorn Ribeye, a salad, and Shiner Bock.   All was excellent although my steak was medium rare when I ordered rare.  The staff here was very friendly, however, and I'm sure they would have remedied the situation had I asked them to... but I don't like wasting food like that.   The staff was also nice enough to bring a free sample of the smoked sirloin, which was most excellent.All in all my experience was great.  All of the guys working at the bar were really cool, friendly, and helpful, the food tasty, and the prices are right.

I understand and do not mind waiting if there are no tables available but this is not the case here. They just want you to wait for no reason. We walked in again tonight and looked around there were Maybee 15 tables that actually had people sitting down of the 50 or more tables they have. The HOSTES says how many? We tell her 2 she says it is going to be a 10-15 min wait. I ask her is something going on maybe a party or something? Are all the tables reserved? No we are just short on waiters, it will be 10-15 mins. We just left, I AM FED UP WITH THIS LOCATION. I love the food but I do not like waiting to start with much less waiting without a purpose.

there is no decent pizza in Austin they said..  can't get real authentic Italian food they said.. hah.. obviously they haven't been to Numero28.Moved into the neighborhood and decided we wanted pizza to celebrate.  Had walked by this place a few times so decided to stop in.  Small authentic Italian restaurant owned by a family that has restaurants in NY and Miami I believe.  The waiter was the real deal Italian and quickly helped us work our way through the menu and options.We had the Arancina Tradizionale for an appetizer which was rice stuffed with bolognese and some veggies.  It as crispy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside.  Perfection!  We had the Prosciutto pizza for our main course on the recommendation of our waiter.  Not sure I have had a better crust on a pizza. I am a center slice girl and this one had me fighting for the corners!  When we thought we were down we found out they had cannoli. There were three small pieces of heaven served on a plate that made me almost want to cry.  Service - 5 star!Food - 5 star!Save me a table I want to come back soon!,5.0 star rating
"This was a hidden gem to us first timer. Found this place by default. I was very skeptical because when I walked in, there was only a couple people there granted I walked in at 2pm. The waiter was very friendly and recommended some soups for us. My husband started with their soup of the day that he didn't like (sorry forgot what it was called but it tasted like a watered down salsa). We ordered a 12inch Austin Pizza (Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Jalapeño, Sausage, & Red Pepper) and a 18inch 1/2 Rustica (Tomatoe, Mozzarella, Sausage, & Green Pepper) and 1/2 Diavola (Tomato, Mozzarella, & Spicy Salami).  The pizza is a thin crust pizza and not greasy at all. It was just perfect. It was one of the best pizzas I've ate It was just perfect for 2 adults and 3 kids.  We ate the whole thing and we were stuffed.  I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. I recommended this place to my cousin who lives in Austin and tell her it's a must try.On a side note, the waiter notice that my husband didn't like the soup so without us telling him that we didn't like it, he took the soup off our bill.  That was super nice of him and he didn't have to do that.  Kudos to great customer service.",4.0 star rating

"I have been to Italy multiple times and have enjoyed countless Italian pizzas, sandwiches, and salads. Numero 28 is THE CLOSEST thing to real, authentic Italian food that you can get. Even the menu closely resembles that of a menu you would get at a cafe in an Italian city like Florence or Amalfi. The pizza and sandwiches are amazingly flavorful. The same crust used to make the pizza is used to make the paninis. The light, airy, yet crunchy crust makes it hard to put the panini/slice of pizza down once you take your first bite. They are expanding into the space just west of their current space (where How Do You Roll used to be). They already have some outdoor seating but will be incorporating some more patio seating with their expansion. The new space is expected to be completed by September 2016.",5.0 star rating
"I happened upon this great little spot after a terrible experience trying to get service @Second at Congress. I'll be posting on that later. One side is somewhat market like. A beautiful cafe setting. I was greeted immediately. When I explained it was my first time she went over how it worked but then noted that the other side had more dishes, pastas, salads, etc. And it was exactly what I wanted!  Dark lighting, open kitchen, great wine selection, and wines by the glass!  I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana as I always crave it IF it is done right. And boy was it!  No breading or egg wash. ""Simple"" as Marco said. Very thin sliced, stacked over and over. It was. Eying. Appearing almost as a lasagna with light shaved parmigiana on top. Delicioso!",5.0 star rating
"Had dinner at Numero 28 on Saturday evening. The biggest plus was that they had multiple white pizza options, since I usually prefer a white pizza to a pizza with red sauce. I ordered the 4 formaggi which is a white pizza topped with Parmesan, Brie, Gorgonzola, and mozzarella. Yum! Lots of flavor. I got the 12 inch which was plenty big and I ended up having leftovers. Boyfriend got the Margherita, which was really just a cheese pizza with a few little pieces of basil on it. Generally, I'm used to Margherita pizzas having fresh sliced mozzarella, but this one was just made with shredded. The taste was good though. Their crust was the perfect thickness and had a slight chewiness to it. The service at Numero 28 was perfect. Our server was very attentive and the manager came over to check on us while we were eating. I wish I hadn't been so full at the end or I would've gotten a cannoli! They have gelato too.",4.0 star rating
I don't think I have ever had dinner somewhere that every item was so bland.   I ordered a cocktail and it was terrible.  Probably the worst Moscow Mule ever.   The Caesar salad was equally underwhelming.   The lasagna lacked flavor.  Even the gelato was disappointing.   I have always had the best of meals anywhere in Austin.  Not here.,1.0 star rating

"Can't seem to find a time they're open. I've tried to get a drink at this restaurant two times in one week and have been turned away both times by two different servers telling me they're closed. The first time I came 20 minutes before closing in hopes of only getting their Aperol spritz. They told me and my boyfriend they were already closed. Tonight I got there at 9:15 and there were chairs in front of the entrance and another server informed us they were already closed. My boyfriend called their number and the man (manager?) told him the restaurant was now called Number 35 and that they were still open when he called at 9:21. We told him over the phone that we were just turned away and he again rudely informed us that it was 9:21 and they're open until 10 pm. As excited as I was about someone serving up an Aperol spritz in town, I won't be back.",1.0 star rating
Amazing! Came here last night and nothing disappointed! Had the porchetta which was very flavorful. The boyfriend ordered their diavola pizza and let me tell you that pizza is the closest to a true roman pizza that you'll get here in the states.

"This is the most delicious restaurant I've eaten at in Austin. It was so so good!! We got the Arancina tradizionale for an appetizer and it was so yummy. Then we got the numero 28 pizza and the cannelloni. Each were the best pizza/cannelloni that I have ever eaten. We were already stuffed but with everything being as good as it was, we HAD to get the cannoli for dessert. It was fantastic. I cannot rave about this place enough. Not to mention the staff is extremely friendly and the restaurant has very warm vibes. This is now a place that I recommend to everyone and will take people to when they visit me in Austin.",5.0 star rating
"Guys this place was amazing! I've never been to Italy but I felt like we weren't in Austin the whole time! I have family in from Princeton NJ and my nephew insisted on pizza. The service was great, the food was great and the atmosphere was awesome, we sat on the patio which is dog friendly. Check it out if you haven't been. It's a little Italian gem on 2nd street!

"My wife and I stopped here before a movie at Violet Crown which is upstairs from Numero28 (VC has some good food but the food and bar service can be inconsistent). So we came here to try the wine and appetizers. We ordered the house red, and Caponata con Crostini and Crocchette di Patate. The caponata was served cold, which is okay but definitely would taste better at room temperature. The Crocchette were also good, but were on the dry side and could have been served with warm tomato sauce instead of the mayonnaise.But - both dishes were short on salt. This is one of the simplest and most annoying mistakes a chef can make - many if not most dishes need enough salt to taste balanced, and if it's not there, it means either they don't know what it should taste like, or they're not event tasting their own dishes. On top of this, they didn't even have salt shakers for the tables (we asked).It's a cute and reasonably priced cafe, so we'll be back sometime to try the pizza, and it would be a shame if the rest of it has the same uneveness.",3.0 star rating
"After getting into the Austin area late Friday night, we stumbled upon this gem.  Very hidden and low-key, but Numero28 was nothing short of delicious and authentic.  I would recommend their prosciutto pizza and outdoor patio to anyone.  The staff were all so welcoming and friendly, and our server was very attentive. We also didn't have to wait for a table which was nice.  Besides this location, Numero28 has restaurants in New York and London, which also attests to how great it is!",5.0 star rating
"I never shut up about my trip to italy last year. give me an opening, any opening, and i will work those stories into any conversation. you got new shoes? did i tell you about the shoes i saw in venice? your dog hurt his paw? have i told you the story about my cousin's three dogs back on the olive farm in sicily? i fell in love with everything about italy, especially the 40 cousins i had no idea i'd be meeting (see? there i go). obviously the food in italy is awesome. this is great, but then you come home and suddenly you have to add quotes to all your favorite ""italian"" places - which, by the way, used to satisfy you just fine but now, sigh, ho hum, they're just not italian enough.so when the lovely keri b suggested we go check out this new numero 28 spot on 2nd street, i was intrigued but kind of resigned to it being one cannoli short of the real deal. i am happy to report that i was delighted from first bite to last. I kept alternating between asking our server if things on the menu were ""legit"" and telling him ""i'm so excited!"". he was a good sport and explained that they serve only food whose ingredients are imported from italy. yeah, that's legit. from the charcuterie plate we built and the selection of olives we devoured (red olives!? oh yes we can), to the arancina and the lasagna, everything was delicious. and the cannoli - oh mo dhia - just like the cousins made for me back in sicily. did i mention that i took a trip to italy last year?...this is a small chain with most of their restaurants in new york. and who in the US knows italian food better than new yawkas? it's small, and it's packed, and it's all hustly and bustly like a big italian meal should be. i'm so glad they found their way to austin! go try these guys and you'll be glad too.",4.0 star rating
"My childhood was as ""white bread"" as you can get.  Dinners with our family of five usually included canned green beans, Kraft mac n cheese or some other variety of prepared foods while watching Mork and Mindy or the Hulk.  The most my family engaged with each other was fighting over forks on fondue night.  And, really, I was perfectly fine with that cause I didn't know any better.Dining European style is completely different.  It's chaotic and loud and boisterous and vivacious and a complete social engagement, replete with super fresh food.  This was our experience at Numero 28.  Ours was a last minute decision to try to cram a party of 9 into what I knew to be a tiny place on a Saturday nite, so I called Saturday afternoon when they were still officially closed and left a voicemail and an email as well to request a reservation.  I was promptly called back about 10 minutes later and was happy to receive a 6:45 spot.  They were very accomodating, explaining the size of the restaurant and that they have other big parties coming at 7:30 and could we plz come at 6:45?  No problem!The place is tiny with only 3 large party/communal tables, about 3 two tops and bar seating.  And it got PACKED.  I would recommend reservations if possible or come very early or after 8:30.  It took a minute for us to get our drinks and again, we pretty much had to flag the waitstaff down to order our food, but we took it all in stride, the European way.Our large party ordered an assortment of the many small plate choices available, everything from a meat and cheese plate to the caponata, the arancita to the lightest fried calamari, the carpaccio to these divine potato/cheese puffs.  Everything was happily passed around as we all talked and laughed together and enjoyed our tap wine or beer.  Our waiter, Mark (Marco?), was clearly running his ass off all nite ( I agree the place is understaffed...just not sure where they would put more staff!) but still, in the midst of chaos and stress, he would joke around with us and make us laugh.We went on to order entrees, my choice being the best lasagna I've ever had, while others sampled the flatbread pizza or just reordered their favorite apps again. Then we finished up with espressos and dessert.  We got the full Italian meal deal for about $50/person.  So incredibly worth it!If my family meals were ""white bread"", this was the parmesan garlic bread version and I loved it.  Can't wait to go back.",5.0 star rating
"This is one of my spots that I love to eat at. Tonight it was absolutely horrible. Every roll came out subpar. Especially the delicious volcano that I live for. It was so disgusting. Couldn't even tell what it was it had so much crumble on the top of it...Updated!!This place is really going down. I think because they stay so busy they have gotten away from customer service. Service was terrible as far as getting seated. We were seated at a table that was empty from the moment we arrived. We still waited 35 min to be seated at a table that was vacant when we walked in. The volcano roll has been lost in all the crunch they now add. It was extremely dry. Never again, this was me giving it another go after being extremely disappointed the last time.

"GREAT place to ""pregame"" for awesome food and drinks before a night out. I've only been here during the reverse happy hour (after 10PM), but it's so worth it. Only downside is that service is slow and it's hard to track down a server because they all walk so fast without making eye contact with anyone.. kind of annoying, but after you've been here once you'll learn to immediately place a first order to get the ball rolling. Sushi is pretty solid, no complaints. My favorite starters include the tofu and seafood salad. The sake bombs are fun especially if you're with a group of friends. As someone who isn't even a fan of beer, I was pleasantly surprised! Such a great deal, and once you get the first round you can keep the plastic cups they serve it in (it has a mini shot cup attached inside for the sake and the beer is poured around it), and then just order hot sake and a few beers separately. So yes, I'd definitely come back for future happy hours. You can't go wrong.",4.0 star rating

"Happy hour makes me happy. Especially when these hours include sushi and drink specials. And especially when these hours are all day on Sunday! Bar chi does happy hour right by having daily happy hours, as well as reverse happy hours and all day Sunday specials. The prime downtown location makes this sushi spot a perfect place for pre- night out festivities. Get your yummy sushi fix and some $2 sake bombs with some friends and head out to town!This night I tried the Austin roll and chi roll. The chi roll was my favorite, but Austin roll had just as much fish and was fully satisfying as well. The rolls here are average in fish portions and a little above average in the quality for as trendy (and thus less authentic) as it is. Drinks can be pricey once you realize how many you'll probably end up ordering, but the lychee martinis and sake bombs were the favorites of the table.Because barchi is such a popular spot, service and wait times are sacrificed majorly. We waited at least 25 minutes before having a server even approach our large table and also waited a while for our food and drinks. In addition, some of our orders were forgotten, but given how busy it was, it's a little more understandable. Thus my rating is pretty average- I still encourage you to visit if the opportunity arises though! You may get better luck on your visit.",3.0 star rating

My husbands food also took about 30 min longer than everyone else's food. The host staff's excuse was that the service depends on the waiter/waitress and it was really busy.

"Umi was just weird. That's really all I can say about it. Service was interesting (that's my nicer way of saying weird). The server always filled my water glass to the point it spilled or overflowed on the table. She apologized each time, but really? More times? It happened enough to make me feel creeped out by it and questioning her problem solving skills.What really took this down a notch was that everyone received their rolls at extremely different times. We ALL ordered sushi. One person sat with sushi for a good 15-20 minutes before we received about half of our order. Then, one for someone else, one for the other person...again, I shall use the word WEIRD. Why? WHY? When our rolls came out, we both got the intense whiff of fish. The bad smell. I thought maybe it was our salmon skin, because that does tend to stink in that special way, but it wasn't even there! I wasn't sure what was going on until I tasted everything. Okay...everything sort of tastes like the salmon skin. Finally, when I mentioned that I didn't like all the crunchies on top, the server chimed in to tell us that those were not tempura flakes, they were fried fish skin! She was very proud of this fact. Thrice I say, WHY?!?!? Umi just ruined everything in the weirdest way it could.",2.0 star rating

I've been craving their spicy edamame for a while since the first time that I was there. It was sooooo good but this time, it was eh. The spice is not soaked into the edamame. So it tasted plain. Not worth the 6 bucks. Hamachi was really good. I was just really disappointed with the spicy edamame. The teriyaki chicken was meh. I like my mall teriyaki chicken better. More flavor. Everything else was good. Also it gets pretty rowdy.",3.0 star rating
"I went into Umi today with my boyfriend wanting to try out a new place for Sushi. Unfortunately our experience with Umi was completely horrible and we walked out. My boyfriend order 30 dollars worth of rolls and I ordered a bento box and asked our waitress to substitute the California roll for a cucumber roll instead.  She said that it most likely wasn't possible and if they did do it that there would be a small fee to which I said that's fine. So she took our order and a couple minutes later another waiter brought our drinks my boyfriend's drink was wrong which wasn't why we ended up leaving.The female manager walked over to our table after we had our drink and our order had been in for 5ish or so minutes and started bitching me out about how I can't make a substitution, and how I can't have a cucumber roll and how I would be wasting their California rolls (which I'm asking them not to make) and how I can only have an extra gyoza or edamame. She was holding the ticket in my face shaking it at me and pointing, she was really rude to me and was raising her voice to me in front of other patrons that were sitting around us. We tried to sit there and ask about other ways to order and the only real answer I got from her was I basically couldn't eat the food I wanted and I have to take the California roll whether I wanted it or not. My boyfriend wanted to leave so we paid our 6 dollar drink tab and left. So instead of us spending 60-70 dollars at Umi, we went next door to Texas Land and Cattle where I didn't get yelled at or told how I couldn't eat the food I wanted to order.",1.0 star rating

"First time ordering from Umi. We had the Obake roll and the Crouching Tiger roll along with some spicy garlic edamame. The edamame was the only thing actually good. The spicy yellowtail had gone bad - SO fishy. You could smell it as soon as you opened the container. My husband tried to eat a piece, but he ended up spitting it out. I wasn't sure if he was being picky (although we have high standards for sushi), so I gave it a shot. It was pretty bad, and I'm hoping that my stomach handles it okay. The other roll was edible, not fishy, but the color of the tuna was that oxidized dark reddish color that looks like something you would find at the discount grocery store's sushi section. We did call the restaurant to let them know the yellowtail was definitely no good, and they had said we can come in and ask for the person we spoke to and get a roll on the house. Honestly, I'm not sure if we will take them up on it - if a place is okay serving rancid fish, I can't trust it. Too many options in the area to risk it. But the edamame was very good.

Happy hour is awessssooooommmmme but that's pretty much where the good stuff ends.Service is slow and complacent. It takes like 15 minutes to get drinks and that's if you remind the server. I asked for a roll without cream cheese and was answered with ""oh those rolls are pre made"" um okay but you have all of the ingredients on hand yes? So can they not throw one together? Also gross @ the idea of pre made sushi even if it's going to be deep fried.",3.0 star rating
Went during lunch and the lunch specials were on point.  I had two of the special rolls for 20 dollars and it came with miso soup and ginger dressed salad.  The salad was generic but the soup was pretty good.  It didn't taste like just miso mixed with water.  The rolls were nice and fresh.  The seasoning on the rice wasn't too overpowering.  They gave me the happy hour menu just to check it out and it seemed really good.  They have live music Friday and Saturday too.,4.0 star rating

"Surprisingly good sushi & sashimi, given the location.Fried tofu, Firecracker roll, and Go To Hell rolls were all must-try.I'll second Lesley's review...the service was very odd.There were two small lights on in the entire restaurant, we asked three different staff members to turn the lights on, and it took them 30 minutes to do it...even though we were one of only two parties in the entire place. The first member of our party to order was the very last one to get his food; it came out all at once, and about 20 minutes after everyone else received their food.Our service was also oddly devoid of expression and robotic...helpful, just really odd.",3.0 star rating
"Happy hour everyday  4-6:30PM. Thurs 9:30-11PM. Friday & Sat 9:30-midnight.Prices are right. Sushi is really pretty decent. Their albacore is decent, goyza's are yummy. Their crunch shrimp roll (AKA Shrimp Tempura Roll) is pretty good! But, FYI, their California rolls are garnished with fish eggs, which taste like nothing, but some people don't enjoy. I am sure if you ask for it without them, they would make it without. I like it either way. OH! And Blue Moon on tap!!! YESSSS!",5.0 star rating
"I went here for lunch one day when I was really feeling a smoothie and a kale salad. I wasn't too impressed with the salad. I've had better. The smoothie however was great. It just took 10 minutes for them to make it, which I felt was a little long. The menu was pretty extensive and they had other prepackaged meals you could choose from. I think I will try a different salad the next time. I heard a lot of people raving about the Kombucha, which looked really good. The prices were reasonable. I got everything for around $12. And they had some outdoor seating available. If you haven't tried their smoothies yet - go for it!",3.0 star rating
Delicious but a little pricey. But what is something like this actually supposed to cost? It's all fresh ingredients. You can tell a smoothie is good by how thick it is. This is like a shot of health straight to the body. Friendly people here too.,5.0 star rating

"Maybe I'm not hip enough for Austin, but I find Daily Juice to be only ""ok.""  All in all, it is quite expensive, and while they do use alot of fresh ingredients, many of them are already frozen.  I feel like when you are paying top dollar for a juice or a smoothie, most, if not all, of the ingredients should be fresh. The pre-packaged quinoa salad is quite tasty, although it would benefit from more vegetables.  The vegetables included are few and far between, making the whole thing a little carb heavy and not as balanced as it could be.  The Rainbow connection smoothie is also quite tasty, (be aware it's listed as a ""green smoothie"" but is not green in color) but they will randomly change the ""spinach"" to ""kale"" and vice versa, which is frustrating.  If you have a recipe for something, stick to it so your customers can have an expectation as to what they will receive, or communicate that change to the customer, so they know BEFORE they try it (which inevitably will occur once they leave your establishment, and an unable to return).They do have a relatively reasonable lunch special from 11-1, but be advised, it ends EXACTLY at 1:00 pm.  1:04 pm with a line inside?  You will be turned down by the rather rude hipster working the register.  1:15 pm? Don't even bother.  If their attitude was better, or this was a larger chain, I could understand this behavior a little more.  But being a small juice place in Austin.... come on.All in all, if you are downtown and want a healthy lunch, go the few extra blocks and get yourself a salad from Leaf.",3.0 star rating
"So I've been kind of been pounding the juice of late, a no doubt futile attempt to reconcile all the overheated days and sloppy nights that accompany most of your major music festivals, and it became a bit of a rallying cry in the process: ""let us detox before we re-tox."" It may surprise you to note that there was not a physician present. The Daily Juice has clearly been found out and during SXSW folks were pressed in here like wheatgrass in the squeezer: determined to put something good in my body before I found it attacked by free beer and chips, I waddled in in pursuit of salvation. What I found, ultimately, was a strawberry-banana concoction, a sort of cooling agent crammed into a cup that brought about a vitamin C infusion. I enjoyed it (and they have a check in offer, which I found especially cool). So why the 3 star rating? In short one of the benefits of this location (that you can get your hands on lots of healthy goodness) was also a shortcoming during SXSW, as they were out of a good number of specialty items key to the menu.I'd imagine I'll fare better on a trip back with the out of towners gone. So a re-review's in order. But for now, Daily Juice and I are off to a decent, but not spectacular, start.",3.0 star rating
"I go to Daily Juice often because it is right around the corner from my office.

Every smoothie is configured to taste awesome as well.

I had my fill of various small plates while enjoying good wine throughout the meal. I was surprised this place wasn't more crowded. Everything was superb.The only change I would make is the lighting.

"The location is wonderful on 2nd street next to nice boutiques and other restaurants. The weather was cool and the restaurant had all of its windows and doors open, creating an inviting atmosphere. I came here on a Friday at 5:30PM right at the start of happy hour and there were three couples sitting around the bar. My friend and I came in and stood around for three minutes before someone sat us down, but I wasn't in a hurry so I didn't mind. Our server Zach was really nice and attentive. We were waiting on a third party and he checked on us often until the entire party arrived and were able to order. Once we did he let us sit in peace without interrupting us, until he came around to ask if we wanted to order a second flight.  We each ordered a flight of wine which is a wonderful idea for wine amateurs such as myself. We even were given cards with the flights so that we would know what we were drinking. We had the cheese platter which was great with three different types of cheese (all amazing), honey with the honeycomb in it, fresh fig jam, fruit and bread. I would highly recommend the plate because it went well with Chardonnay Flight that I had.  Happy Hour is $3 off flights and there are some food items that are discounted. I cannot wait to be back there soon!",5.0 star rating
"The review is soley based on 2 things: the cheese fondue and the Jules Taylor sauvignon blanc.The 3 cheese fondue (fontina, gruyere and gorgonzola) was a gonner nearly as soon as it arrived to our table.  Those are three of my favorite cheeses anyway, and then add in truffle oil into the mix and it was perfect.  The dipping items were unique and delicious: apple and pear slices, roasted fingerling potatoes, baby artichoke hearts and french bread.The Jules Taylor is out of New Zealand and as such is at a bargain price, particularly if you're here on a Sunday when it's a third off all bottles of wine for happy hour.  It was crisp and refreshing and I'd highly recommend it for your summertime drinking pleasure.",4.0 star rating
"I'd write a review of the happy hour food and wine at Cru but I didn't get that far. I went in and asked if I could sit outside; ""sure someone will be with you in a minute and I should sit anywhere."" A server handed me a menu and I went ahead, took my menu and seated myself. Not big deal. It wasn't busy, I'm not in a rush. I then waited for the server to come. Then, I waited some more. Ten minutes go by another table sits down and almost immediately a server brings the two ladies water. Way to push your business down the street Cru.  The sad thing is I know for a fact they are better than this.",1.0 star rating
"Austin Restaurant Week, Part 3: Brunch at Crú Following the Palm Sunday service at St. David's, I decided to take a brisk walk from the church down to Crú to meet Dr. Ann and Ashford for yet another Sunday brunch. We had made last minute reservations the day before for 1:45 (which is a little late for us), but I figured if we showed up beforehand, we might be seated earlier. I arrived slightly before my people, and informed the host (possibly the manager as well) that I had reservations, but was a bit early. He responded that that was not a problem at all, and that they'd be happy to have me sit at the bar, and ""the restaurant is yours; be our guest"". There's nothing quite like a genuine welcome to start a brunch off right. The girl behind the bar was all smiles, and handed me both the regular and ARW menus, along with a mimosa. I asked her what she would recommend for the entree during ARW; she replied with the Croque Madam, which is basically the Croque Monsieur (smoked ham + melted gruyere cheese + bechemel sauce + toasted croissant), topped with a sunny side up egg. A waiter passing by chimed in and informed me that this was only being offered during Restaurant Week, and it's an awesome old fashioned dish I had to try since I had the chance. Actually his exact words were ""If you want a croque madam, you'll either order it today, or take a time machine back in the 1800s."" Well, he had definitely made up my mind for me. Great input. Dr. Ann and Ashford arrived, and even though it was 1:30 or so, the host/manager said we could go ahead and take a seat; we chose a corner booth by a window overlooking their patio. Sadly, this alarmingly hot spring weather was what prevented us from requesting a seat outside.Mimosas are $4/glass individually, and $8 for bottomless. Obviously, go for the bottomless. ""Coincidentally"", the three of us each wanted to order the three separate entree choices, and the three separate dessert choices. Either that, or they already knew ahead of time that's exactly what I wanted them to do, so I would be able to try everything. I think you can guess which scenario it really was. My croque madam was a masterpiece of layered flavors, from the buttery croissant to the flavorful ham topped by the creamy bechemel. Dr. Ann's steak and eggs (cooked medium rare) were tender and a much more substantial portion of protein than I had expected. Ashford also enjoyed the eggs benedict. The only mild criticism were the sides of herb roasted potatoes; they were underwhelming, tiny, and a little overdone. They paled in comparison to the very strong main courses. But of course, like I said, this was a very minor quibble. Dessert did not disappoint, either. My blackberries, blueberries, strawberries and cream were a light way to finish brunch, with a citrus lemon mousse that could almost pass for a meringue. Dr Ann's molten chocolate cake was all sorts of decadent, and enhanced by the crèam anglaise and raspberry coulis that were artfully presented. But the real star was Ashford's French Toast, made from sourdough and topped with Cap'n Crunch and fresh berries. Warm maple syrup was served on the side, so as not to overwhelm. I never would have thought to use the cereal, but it gave a nice crispy texture to a French toast that was deliciously more savory than sweet. It was unanimously our favorite. Our waitress(es) were on top of everything, and our mimosas were never empty. This is VERY important. Service at Crú, whether first walking in up to paying our check, was stellar. It seemed like everyone enjoyed being there, and that comes across to the customers whether they realize it or not. A+. The other patrons looked like a nice group...certainly not as cutthroat at the See-And-Be-Seen bitch crowd down the way at Taverna. However, I couldn't help but call a time out during our conversation to point out that besides the staff, Ashford appeared to be the only straight guy in the place. One look, and Dr. Ann bust out laughing because--as usual--it was completely true. And quite amusing. You know...I had originally wanted to give Crú 4 Stars, but writing out the experience has convinced me they deserve a 5. They deserve one because they offered the perfect brunch: they kept the balance between laid back but classy, on the ball but not intrusive, and their upbeat vibe was a real treat. Throw in the consistently excellent food and the bottomless mimosa special, and I just can't think of a reason not to bump them up to the Best of the Best of Brunch. 5 Stars! Can't wait to return.",5.0 star rating
"""Wine and Bubbly Flights Galore""Perusing 2nd I stopped in at Cru. A quaint venue with Abair and dining room. I happened upon happy hour! I tried several small plates- my favorite was the margarita flatbread! But ultimately Cru offered a wonderful flight menu....it made it so hard to choose. I went with a flight of bubbly! It was the perfect selection for a warm evening in Austin- sparkling and refreshing. My bartender was knowledgeable about my selections. The pours were not stingy either. And I was provided with a descriptive of each of my flight samples. If you like wine, this a great option for you in Austin, offering wines from around the world and a nice selection from several regions of my favorite wine state- California!!!",4.0 star rating
"We wanted bbq, alas it was hour plus wait.  So found Cru.  I think they should take wine bar off the name.  Almost discouraged us from going for dinner.  We went in, place was not crowded at all (scary, my antennae were up).  Pleasantly surprised-  our server, who I think was also the person handling the wine bar, was fantastic!!!!  She knew the menu, her suggestions were great and she cared about the food and service..  Thank you.  Tartare app and caprice salad, very solid.  Chicken in a lemon caper broth was delicious, short ribs a solid choice.  Thx Cru, I'm gonna find the bbq tomorrow night.",4.0 star rating
"Well to start, I'm not a hipster; far from it--at least in the realm of not having a beard, skinny jeans, hypocritical disdain for society, tattoos, or atypical career... but I do have a record player.  And Cru is far from a hipster bar and in no way 'divey'.   But for some reason, I love my wine bars to have a little more character and a little less glitz.  To clarify, Cru is a very nice, high end looking wine bar with bright lighting, well manicured staff, organized tables in a linear setting, and a very clean, air conditioned, modern feel.  But for a wine bar, I much prefer places like House Wine, Opa, or Uncorked.... all places that are located in nicely converted old homes with dim lighting, and comfortable seating (think a mix of couches, deep cushion seats, and standard tables).  They are still just as sanitary and clean as Cru, but have a more relaxed feel better for a non pretentious type date.  Having said that, Cru is still a nice looking place.  I haven't tried the food, so my rating is all in reference to the wine, price, ambiance, and service, which wasn't bad.  But in comparison to the aforementioned wine bars around town, Cru did have a more formal feel--more like a place I'd go for a business dinner (which could be good for that occasion), rather than a place I'd go to drink a bottle of wine and relax with a few friends or a date.",3.0 star rating

Stopped by with my husband for an hour before our dinner reservations down the street. We sat at the bar and had a couple of glasses of wine and an appetizer. Loved the atmosphere! The lighting was dim and romantic yet fun because of the large loud groups that were seated at the tables. Good vibe for a date night. the decor is also so neat. The only downside was the service. Not so friendly bar tenders kind of dampered the mood. She seemed like she was just too busy to make suggestions and barely spoke to us. I see on other reviews this was a complaint too.

"I've only had their juices so far.  The juices are great.  (How does anyone with a juicer get juicing wrong..?)   I have been there on my lunch hour 5 times so far, and on 2 of those instances my order was gotten wrong. :( The first time, I ordered a ""Forest of the Sprites"", which is amazing BTW, and I was told that the juicer was down.  They found a way to get the juicer working again, which I totally appreciated.  I had already forked out the $9.75 after tax for a large sized juice.  Well, they made a small sized juice.  No worries, they will fix the size.  Since this juice has apples, mint and ginger, it is a delicate balance keeping the ginger from overpowering and literally burning your throat.  When they re-did the small into a Large, which I had paid for, they simply doubled the recipe instead of re-doing the drink.  This would have been fine except the amount of ginger it called for was unbearable to drink.  I didn't realize this until I walked 3 blocks back to the office.  Since I literally couldn't drink this drink with the throat-burning amount of ginger they put in, I called and explained and the manager happily offered to re-make it.  So, they had to re-do my drink, a third time.  When I walked over to pick it up, it was already made and in their freezer, but the manager used ""pressed apple juice"" (which means NOT fresh from the juicer, as I had paid top dollar for) and mint.  No ginger.  So, when they finally got my drink made, it still wasn't even right.  But I just drank it anyways.  $9.75 would have bought 2 two-gallon jugs of pressed cold apple juice from HEB, but I digress. I went back, because I really wanted to like their juices, which again are fabulous (when they are made correctly and when you feel like spending $11 for a juice).  I ordered a Large Forest of the Sprites, paid my $9.75, and waited (and waited...and waited...) When it finally came up, alas..it was a Small.  So, I had to ask for a large, and the person making my drink went to go and simply double the recipe.  Since I didn't want a repeat of having to have my over-gingered drink done a third time, I interrupted her (which I felt incredibly rude to do, but hey I was saving her effort of having to make it a THIRD time) and I requested that she please not add more ginger, which she didn't.  I definitely felt like a major pain in the *ss even though I was only trying to get what I paid for.  They put their customers in an awkward position when they get the order wrong and then dont realize simply doubling a recipe cant be done when youre using ginger.  So, I think I will be frequenting Blenders and Bowls instead - they are always nice, always get my order right, and they have juice now, too.",2.0 star rating

Imagine you've been walking around without water for 3 days because you were mugged by a Bedouin tribe member and he took it and ran off on his camel!

Suddenly, you see a man walking towards you! You think it's a mirage, but it's not! It's a well-dressed man wearing a Daily Juice t-shirt. Again, you think you're hallucinating. Daily Juice? What is THIS?! You reach your hand out and you can feel the man's biceps! They're strong and REAL! He then hands you a compostable-cup that is full of a green frothy liquid. You have no choice but to drink! You're dying of thirst! Once you sip on that straw, you enter another dimension. That's pretty much what the Barton Springs tastes like - that feeling of amazing relief and delicious satisfaction that comes from not having something so great for so long. How can you ever make yourself juice again? You can't! And who better to make it than some awesome, polite employees who are not only helpful but relaxed! I don't blame them for being so epic, they work in a clean environment where they can sip on juice all the time! Have you met Taylor?! His hair is glorious and his skin is so clean! I bet he has juice everyday! In closing, amazing juices, great staff, clean location - you can't even get me started on the food... you'll go into a coma if you try the Zucchini Pesto Rolls or whatever they're called. It's like raw-sushi-heaven. I bet God has a Daily Juice shirt, they're THAT good.If you don't come here, you're missing out!",5.0 star rating

"Once upon a time I got stood up. So I spent my time shopping at Francesca's and Langford Market and eventually  wandered across the street to Cru Wine Bar. One day I'll learn how to type with accent marks. Anyway,  I'd been before but never alone. It seemed like a more intimate date-drink spot to me. I settled at the bar and thought I'd kill an hour or so before throwing in the towel of fun on my free evening, so I ordered a glass of champagne. What was intended to be a girls' afternoon of drinks and gossip and pretending our vapid whining made us somehow important and intriguing instead turned into me awkwardly getting to know the former body builder next to me who showed me pictures of his fitness model wife while we sipped wine and talked about muscles and event planning jobs. Oddly, it turned into an amiable encounter and afternoon. To my right sat the suits who discussed their recent vacations to Aspen and how expensive their high school daughters were becoming. Behind me, doting couples got to know each other in the lounge-like seating area. It was an interesting, perhaps eclectic conglomeration of characters, but what they all had in common was peaceful gathering and being interested in good wine and personal conversation. The setting at Cru lends to this. The service is sophisticated and experienced, politely guiding you through wine tastings. To the unlearned wine drinker, they will glean your preferences and find something that suits your taste. I don't recall if there was a TV above the bar, but in this cozy and upscale setting, it would seem out of place to zone out of your surroundings and into short-attention-span-land. Honestly, it's a wonderful spot to refresh after enjoying the quaint 2nd street shops, or perhaps as a pre or post dinner indulgence.",4.0 star rating
"My husband and I went there for dinner before we went to the ballet on 12/12/15 and it was awesome.  The food, especially the lamb lollipops, and the wine flights were wonderful.  Anthony, our server was so great and very knowledgeable about the wines.  We will definitely go back!",5.0 star rating
"Had a couple wine flights.  A couple of wines were definitely open past pour by date. They replaced those but I should not have to point out.  How hard is it to taste wine before sending off if know bottle has been open for a few days.    Food wise, the happy hour potstickers and calamari were great.   Grilled cheese is amazing.  Pizza amazing- doughy and fresh tasting.  The braised short rib which I have had at the domain location was much bigger piece of meat.  Also, this one was over done. They said You don't need a steak knife since so tender but if you want one, I can get one.  I said no and then wished I did.  It was almost like chewing beef jerky on the crust to get to the slightly softer meat below.  4 forks and I was done including even amounts of polenta to meat.  I had another 4 or 5 forks of polenta left over with nothing to go with it.    I would have complained but had a show to go to.   Oh well.",2.0 star rating
"We went here for a family style brunch before a wine tour. The location is convenient the staff friendly and the bread basket yummy (all kinds of goodness in there like muffins, banana bread, etc).  The eggs they server were okay, nothing spectacular and the potatoes were seasoned well, but again nothing exciting.  Of course the mimosa was delicious! I'm not sure if this is what brunch is like for everyone, or just what they give for big groups that come in.  I'd like to come back and try some dinner items, but probably don't need to come back for brunch with all the other great options in town.",3.0 star rating
"Just experienced my first brunch at Cru. The restaurant itself is fairly small indoors, but they have a nice patio, which is perfect for an overcast day like today. Service was excellent, we never had a problem or a wait to get food or drink. Thanks Alaina!The $9 refillable mimosas may be one of the best deals in town. I drank for 3 hours straight for $9, that's unheard of! Their profit margins must be pretty slim for those drinks, ha.Food was also tasty, I had the margarita pizza, which was just okay. However, my female companions had some meals that looked phenomenal. Steak & eggs and the eggs benedict were reportedly very tasty. We also had a cheese plate that was superb.",4.0 star rating
"I've been to Cru before, but at a Dallas location. I can't remember ever having a bad time before. It's probably impossible to have a bad time when wine is involved. Step 1: Stop here before drinks & snacks before a show at the Violet Crown CinemaStep 2: Get an Italian wine flight, they are fantastic!Step 3: Order snacks (they have excellent HH prices)Step 4: Order the mussels! (chorizo/jalapeño flavored!)Service was excellent, as it should be. I didn't like where they sat us. The spot almost felt communal and I'm not a fan of this.

I was beyond disappointed with their lack of service. My boyfriend and I just got out of a late show and had 20 minutes till closing. We walked in and the man who seemed to be the manager said they were still open and to sit wherever. All we wanted was a glass of wine nothing too crazy. I sat down as my boyfriend went to the bathroom and neither of the two servers came to our table. I thought maybe once my boyfriend sat down they would but no they continued to talk to their other table and ignore us! All while the guy I assume was the manager just stood there. We got up and left and the manager guy saw us and didn't say a word. Also the server saw us and ignored us! Heard such great things about Cru and was disappointed in the lack of service and common courtesy.,1.0 star rating
Wine! Wine! Wine! This is a great spot to sample various glasses as you enjoy a solid dinner. My girlfriend and I dropped by on Valentine Day's or that weekend and we enjoyed the four course meal. If you have the choice of steak or anything else on their menu...go with the steak! You can thank me later.,4.0 star rating
"A very decent wine bar that really specializes in wine flights.  You can buy wines by the glass of course, but the wine flights are well priced and are a great way to try wines that you may not have thought of trying before or just want to try again.Complementing the wine is a pretty well designed small plates menu....though personally I think its hard to pair the food with the flights. But the bartenders and wait staff are quite knowledgeable or if they are not, they will grab a manager or sommelier to help make decisions on food pairings.Fun place to hang out. Small plates are a bit better than the entrees in my opinion. But definitely worth the visit for any wine lover",3.0 star rating

"Perfect atmosphere, great location to enjoy city nightlife and a just-right menu paired with fun wine flights made this place stand out to me....There was no wait for the patio even though pretty full for a Friday night, service was great and the wine selection was perfect with our food.The crab cake is shareable between almost 3 people. The fig & Gorgonzola bruschetta was incredible with my white wine flight and the salmon was cooked to perfection.""Pretty Fly For A White Wine"" is a fun pairing of Sauvignon Blancs and @ $15, it equals about 1 glass of wine. It was just enough to wet my palette but not too much where you overindulge. They had a champagne flight too that I'd like to try and would definitely go back just for the fig & Gorgonzola bruschetta!",4.0 star rating
"The food and wine is great but the service is the worst service at any restaurant I have ever been to. We have been to the downtown location a hand full of times and every single time we have bad service. I finally convinced my husband to try it one more time and this is what happened. We sat down and ordered our wine. About fifteen minutes later it shows up, which is ridiculous. Then we ordered a charcuterie board and ahi tuna. We never saw our server again. About thirty minutes later I see everyone around us getting their food. I finally mention something to the hostess that we have been waiting thirty minutes for our appetizers (a cheese board and some ahi tuna!!!) Nothing that even needs to be cooked. The hostess says she told her manager. About ten/fifteen minutes later I say to the hostess ""we just want our check."" I'm starving at this point. The manager FINALLY comes out and apologizes and says the cheese board is ready (doesn't even mention the ahi tuna). We said no thank you and paid our bill and left. He gives us a free app for next time. By the end, we had sat at this restaurant for an hour and didn't eat anything! Very very disappointing and will never come back.",1.0 star rating
Crú combines casual with class.  Impeccable service blends with expert suggestions.  Perfect for the wine lover of every type & budget (so long as it is above average).  The wines are paired with delicious nibbles.  I went with new friends and enjoyed a lazy afternoon of fine wine and great conversation.,4.0 star rating
"What a great place for a gaggle of giggling gals! The staff here were very accommodating for our monthly women's wine group from the beginning, e-mailing and calling to check on numbers and reserving tables in the dining room for us, and our waitress, Carenne (sp?), was friendly and knowledgeable about the wines. Here they give you a sample taste before pouring your glass even if you've already had 3 glasses of that same wine. This kept Carenne very busy with our group, which only turned out to be about 9 as opposed to 15, but they never batted an eye after setting aside 4 tables for us, 2 going unused. The wine list is extensive in varietals, with an equal mix of white and red, if you go both ways like I do. But they only offer 3 of each (i.e. 3 Chards, 3 Pinots, etc) and as Darla pointed out, they are lacking in the S American varietals, leaning instead towards French and Italian and American. Everything I tried was good. I was even pleasantly surprised by a Granache, which I typically don't care for and the glasses are $3 off for Happy Hour (making most still $7 and up). They offer half off their stone fired pizzas for Happy Hour and as a group, we sampled most all of them. The Margarita was bland in my opinion, but the pear Gorgonzola was a great mix of sweet and tangy and the best was the sausage/goat cheese/bell pepper, with it's wangy goatiness offset by sweet peppers and basil and salty sausage. The flavors played well together on my palate with nary a timeout. One precaution: When I arrived, sun blinded by the walk from my car, I immediately asked for the restroom and was a bit befuddled by the black toilet, surrounded by black wall tile, sitting on black flooring. I had trouble locating the toilet in my sun-spotted state. I'm pretty sure I hit it tho. Our group really enjoyed our time here, drinking, gossiping, discussing religion, and daydreaming about Taye Diggs......sigh. Another successful combo of great location, great service, great food and wine, and great company!",4.0 star rating
"I am just rating them on Happy Hour. I want to say - I was torn between 3.5 stars - but overall - I rounded up, because they did a lot of things well. As you will read, there is definitely room for improvement. As local HHs go, they have some offerings, but would not be at the top of my list. I look at selection of wines/drinks vs price savings, food offered at a discount, busyness and ambiance of the establishment and service. The Wine Selection - They have an ample selection of wine ($3 off per glass). No Prosecco on last night's list - although the list changes daily. As predominantly a white wine drinker, they lose points for having only predictable whites, no Torrontes, No Albarinos. No Vernaccias, and NO PROSECCO!  The whites they did have were decent - after a reasonably fair Capposaldo Pinot Grigio ($7/HH$4) - I settled on a Jules Taylor Sauvignon Blanc ($9/HH$6) that had a lot of citrus grapefruit flavors. It was quite nice. I understand on Thursdays from 4 to close - all bubbles are 1/2 off the bottle and they do have a La Marcha Prosecco on the bottle list for $36... that may warrant a Thursday HH in the future which could bring up their score. The food - While they have an extensive menu - at HH, they only discount their pizzas to 1/2 price. At full price, they range from $12-$16 and have an assortment of Margherita , Pear with Gorgonzola, Sausage/peppers/goat cheese, Steak and Arugula and a Mushroom pizza. We ordered all except the mushroom pizza, and they were quite tasty. It would be nice if they discounted more than the pizzas, but the pizzas were good. Best pizza? I am torn between the Sausage/pepper/goat cheese and the Pear and Gorgonzola. Both offered a unique flavor combination that you do not usually get to experience on a pizza. The establishment - they have a great patio area and inside is quite comfortable with faux painted walls and floor to ceiling wine rack on the back wall. The crowd - for HH - it was D E A D in there. That surprised me, as it is an ideal location. Perhaps it was because it was Tuesday, or perhaps it was because there are other better deals downtown. Service - It was superb. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about all the wines, and was able to suggest wines to people's liking. She was attentive, friendly and split checks with ease and no drama. It wold be nice if they were a little more price competitive at HH and opened up the food offerings, but all in all it was a nice evening with great friends in a comfortable place.",4.0 star rating

"Went for the reverse happy hour, which had a lot of options. I ordered the lychee martini, which was super sweet but still drinkable, some spicy edamame but was not very impressed since it was just the regular edamame with a spicy seasoning salt on top. The spring rolls were really good, very crunchy and light. Last, I ordered the chi roll. The pepper tuna that topped the roll was phenomenal, however the spicy fish inside was a little too powerful and the flavors were all over the place. Our server was in and out, he was super busy but as you walk past us he could have at least done the head nod to make sure we were ok.

"Good, if not mind-blowing, sushi at very good happy hour prices. So much so that the place was packed during happy hour (5-7, I think) and nearly empty almost to the minute after 7. Service was a bit challenged by the crowd, but not so much that you'd give up (given the prices). Very hipster, with interesting lighting and a happenin' vibe. The oyster shooters were good, as were most sushi rolls we tried. It's not Uchi, but it costs a fraction of what Uchi costs, is I guess what I'm saying.",4.0 star rating

"When I called to place my order today I specifically told the girl who took my order that I have a sever food allergy to shellfish. I can not eat any type. She assured me that she would let the chef know.  I pick up my order to go and get to work only to find there is crab in this roll.  I call and speak with Michael who at first told me it was okay to eat the crab because it's not real, its imitation. When I questioned and said ""are you telling me I won't react because this is not crab? Is this what you are telling me?"" He then argued with me about ""What you want me to do?"" and how he would refund my food only if I return the entire order. I explain i am already back at work and can not return- but if he can, he can come get it. Then he acted like he didn't understand what I was saying. He all of the sudden understood and offered me a free meal. I told him I don't want a free meal, he could refund my card. He argued the sushi came with the meal and i told him to refund a portion, whatever the cost of the pieces of sushi. He refused to to that too. I then asked for the Manager and he kept telling me he was the store manager.  So I asked for HIS manager.  He reluctantly said ""Neil"" but that Neil wouldn't be back till next week.  This is terrible customer service.  I have a severe food allergy.  I could die from eating shellfish.  I conveyed that message to the person who took my order.  I was at work and already over my lunch time and instead Michael thought it would be better to argue with me. And then kept telling me ""that's all I can do."" !!! This is terrible service....  And Michael SUCKS.  Don't eat here!",1.0 star rating

"I came here for lunch around the 1pm on a Wednesday, the girl at the front didn't smile or greet people in any way. Leaving on the table, she looked up like I was bothering her and her only words to me were, ""just one"".Super overrated and overpriced for the quality. Lunch bento boxes come with soup OR small salad, not both like every other single sushi place I've been to with bento boxes. They also aren't Pepsi products vs Coke, not a fan of that either. My miso soup came in a super tiny bowl with a metal IKEA-ish spoon. Really??? The bowl's paint was so old that it was chipping off into my soup, so that was neat. The bento box was served with grilled onions and mushrooms (that was a new one for me), a dumpling and mini egg roll thing, the chicken teriyaki I ordered (which was so drenched in teriyaki sauce that it was almost inedible, not to mention the extremely overpowering ginger taste, which is also a new thing I guess), white rice, and what was supposed to be three pieces of California roll. The three pieces of the California roll were more than half rice, another 25% avocado, and the tiniest piece of crabmeat and cucumber.I also paid six dollars for a spicy tuna hand roll during lunch. The entire experience reeked of cheap food from the browned avocado to the bowl chipping paint into my soup. $20 lunch later and I have to walk to the sushi place two blocks away just to feel like I'm not hungry anymore. I will never, ever go back here again.",1.0 star rating
"It would be 4 stars if the service wasn't so bad. I understand it being busy during reverse happy hour, but the past 3-4 times I've went, the service has been horrible. Our waiter literally took forever to even acknowledge we had sat down (and we were a big group) and then after we finally flagged them down to take our order, it took a while for them to come back. The food itself is pretty decent and the price is worth especially during reverse hh. I love the calamari here and the Austin roll, even though I'm not a huge fan of raw fish. Sake bombs are decent, especially if you use the lychee one. There's other appetizers and rolls that are pretty good as well, just not for me.

I felt unwelcome the second I walked into this establishment.  They said that the kitchen was closing in two minutes.  This leaves the patron in a situation where they feel as if they are bothering the staff to serve them.  The proper approach would have been to fully welcome the guest and NOT rush the or simply say that their kitchen has closed.   This uncertainty leaves the guest feeling unwanted and their business unwelcome.  I will not return here again for their mediocre sushi.,1.0 star rating

"I recently went to BarChi for the first time, to their all-day happy hour on Sunday. While BarChi doesn't compete in the same level as Austin's handful of top-notch sushi, it definitely competes well in the next tier of ""pretty darn good"" sushi. With the happy hour menu, dinner didn't hurt the pocket either.I ordered their lychee martini based on waitress recommendation, and I wasn't disappointed. There are many places that make you feel like you are drinking lychee syrup with a side of sugar bomb, but the martini at BarChi is smooth and balanced, with just the right amount of sweetness.Spicy edamame is fresh and simple.The scallops & bacon small plate is nicely done. The scallop-to-bacon ratio was a bit off - I could have done with larger pieces of scallop, but overall it was well made. The yellow tail roll & the geisha roll were both good too. Overall, good quality food, with a nice ambiance. Service was okay (not terribly attentive, but decent).My only complaint would be the inability to customize things (other than dropping items from rolls). My companion was gluten-free, and all the sauces were soy based, with no tamari-based alternative. So we ended up having to get our rolls without their signature sauces, and just dip in tamari. If barchi went the extra mile and made tamari-based sauces, this would be a great selling point!",4.0 star rating

"I wasn't sure what to give Cru, I think a 3.5 if I could. I went last night with a few friends for restaurant week and my first impression was that it's definitely somewhere I want to try out for a relaxing happy hour or date night, the vibe was great and I loved the decor, but there were a few things that held it back.No less than three people greeted us from the front door to the table (a very short walk mind you), but then it took what seemed like forever for our waiter to show up. He was definitely weeded and unsure, but he seemed to be the only one so it could have just been an off day or a new waiter-whatever, no big deal. Though, a girlfriend of mine ordered all her food gluten free, and he forgot every course. Also, they have definitely trained the bussers to always keep the water glass full, to the point that it was obnoxious-helpful, but too much.After a bit of a wait, first course comes, crab cake with a spicy sauce. It was DELISH-just the right amount of spice, not too fishy but a small portion, would have liked a bit more but that's probably just because it was oh so tasty. Second course-mashed potatoes with a petit fillet and a tomato dish. The steak was cooked perfect, very tasty especially when paired with the potatoes-the potatoes could have maybe used a little salt or spice but that's just my taste. Tomato dish was good.. Sort of bland except for a few bites with some blue (or similar) cheese, THAT was good!Dessert-molten chocolate cake with vanilla and raspberry, it was good but ehh. No better than a boxed cake. I didn't get to partake in the wine but my girlfriends liked it (cc Cabernet).The portions are small but by the end I was so full, and happy with the food even if service wasn't that stellar. I think they have the potential to be great but everyone seemed a little unsure and too eager to please. However, I will definitely be back to see if they can earn a few more stars!",3.0 star rating
"This review comes after several Cru experiences. Occasion 1 - Stopped by after an event with a small group of people for a small bite and glass of wine. Service was on point and the five cheese pizza with truffle oil, and arugula salad on top was phenomenal. (but why write a review over one slice of pizza and one glass of wine?) Occasion 2 - Marketing meeting with 10 others, once again service was on point, Karin's (the server) knowledge of the wine selection was amazing, and the patio served as the perfect area for a 6pm meeting. (once again why write a review over a great patio and wine?) Occasion 3 - Relaxing dinner with my sweetie and a few glasses of red wine... perfect! We had the chefs choice cheese tray and a meat tray for an appetizer; perfectly paired with our wine. Next, the tortellini each bite was a story of its own, mouth watery goodness. Then I remembered that amazing cheese pizza and ordered one, once again Karin paired a glass of wine with the pizza and my taste buds were rejoicing. So now I must write a review! On three separate occasions I have had excellent service, a knowledgeable waitresses, delicious food, and great wine. The inside has a romantic atmosphere for couples, but also serves as a great place to have a conversation over dinner with a small group. The patio has nice large umbrellas and makes for a great happy hour spot or relaxing place for people watching. I can't wait for my next outing at Cru.

"A quick update on Cru from today's visit.  First and foremost, the Sunday brunch at Cru is on again.  Yeah!My friend and I were met at the door by the same waitress who last waited on us 23 months ago and it was a good thing.  Elizabeth's service was excellent again as before.  I was happy to see such staff stability in a restaurant.We totally enjoyed the cheese fondue with the bread, apple, baby carrot, and string bean dippers.  I opted for the Cru House Salad with Ahi Tuna, and that brought the rest of the memories back quickly.I wasn't able to indulge in any libations today, but the glass of house champagne my friend enjoyed was reported to be decent.Happy Sundays are here again at Cru!",4.0 star rating
"My friend threw my wedding shower here.  Nice place.  We had such a large party we got the back room instead of up front.  It was a little warm at times, but the hostess tried her best to keep it cool for us.  The waiter was friendly, the wines delicious, and the company even better.  The food was good, although small portions for the gentlemen.  We had a choice of two salads (wild arugula, watercress, fennel frond, pine nuts, ricotta salata w/ meyer lemon viniagrette or torn bibb, peaches, brown sugar cured bacon, and blue cheese viniagrette, which I chose), and main dish (scampi style seafood capellini with shrimp, calamari, mussels, bell peppers, basil, lemon, and white wine sauce, or pan roasted chicken piccata with lemon, white wine, capers and spicy broccolini or petite filet with niman ranch tender, creamy mashed potatoes, and red wine sauce, which I chose).I had a great time, and highly recommend Cru for any small parties you may have!",4.0 star rating
"Downtown Austin offers a good mix of upscale, iconic eateries and boutique shops such as Roaring Fork and Con Olio as well as casual transplants from other cities i.e. Coal Vines and Taverna.Cru blends both components into a wine bar with a reasonable selection running in stride with an expansive variety of small bites and big plates alike.Located in the 2nd Street district, this spot incorporates a little bit of class into an unpretentious vibe, for the most part. It does give way to some pricier grub and by-the-glass options, but Cru would serve well as a pre- or post-dinner experience a bit different than West 6th, Rainey, or the East side.Note I left out Dirty 6th, as I am fairly certain that crossover would not take place between the two different clientele. Keep your eye out for the different specials rolling out through the week.",3.0 star rating
"I hope you understand the menu better than I did.  The flight names are so cute! When you get down to the dirty detais of dissecting what vinyard each wine is from, or what grape it's made from, or even what kind of wine it is, don't expect your waitress to help.""Oh, the winewamkers all list them differently"".  and ""I'm not exactly sure what that one is; it's new"".Hmm.  Ok.  The goat begneits were a delight.  Sweet, peppery, goat cheesey.  The bruschetta had goat cheese on it too, which was delicious, but maybe that waitress could have let us know so that we didn't order the same kind of food twice.  We'd said we were new.Will I be back?  Probably not.  It was A-OK, and nothing more.  We finished our evening at Bar Chi around the corner.",3.0 star rating
"Having never stepped foot inside of this restaurant, I can only rate my experience as a patron sitting outside on their lovely patio. For prime people watching in an intimate setting, you can't beat Cru. Much shade to work with as well - great service, great food and of course there's wine. Highly recommend for a date night or small group of friends.",4.0 star rating
"The food is, by and large, less deserving of its price.  If you're looking for pricey AND awesome food, there are many places in Austin that will serve you well.Why three stars then?  Cru has an encyclopedic wine list that will please just about anyone.  The seating is great for groups though the lighting is a little too subdued for my taste.  If you're looking for wine with less regard for food, Cru is a great choice for you.",3.0 star rating
"Came here for brunch since Taverna's wait was 2 hours. (Ridiculous) We headed two doors down and settled for Crú and found out that bottomless mimosas were eight bucks a pop. Okay, settled! My group and I sat down in the patio area on an overcast and hot day. We ordered steak and eggs, eggs and crab benedict, some pizzas, and the french toast. In my opinion, the steak and eggs were great and cooked to request. The classic benedict was on point. I had one complaint from a friend saying that the french toast was too cinnamon-y. But is that really possible? (I didn't think so.) My only small complaint was that the portion of the dishes were a bit on the small side. However, the service was good and we were attended to very well. I'll have to make another visit to Crú to try their dinner courses. I've done the flight of wine at another location and loved it!",3.0 star rating
"One of my favorite wine bars ever! I love how they have bottles of wine on the entire wall with one of those old school sliding library ladders, if ya know what I mean. Happy hour specials are pretty good. My friends and I usually split a bottle or two, and we also get one of each appetizer on the menu just to make things easier. The bartenders and servers usually make pretty good recommendations on wine / champagne. Just tell them what you like!Shout out to the Cru in Houston on Kirby!",4.0 star rating
"I rarely write reviews, but today's experience at Cru (downtown) was so fabulous that I just had to shout out about it. I'm on their email list, and today's my birthday; so I received a message a week or so ago that gave me a free entree during my birthday week (no blackout days or times, no limitations). So my husband and I arrived there at about 1:15 today, and we were treated to marvelous food, wine, and service. Between the attentiveness and suggestions from Chris James (the General Manager) and our server John, everything was top notch from start to finish! Since I was being given a free entree, I went for one of the ""big plates""--short ribs with gorgonzola polenta. When I said I wasn't really a gorgonzola fan, Chris assured me that the polenta was made on the spot and that they could substitute another type of cheese (which they did, and it was wonderful). We also had the heirloom tomatoes appetizer, and it was equally delicious. And as a special surprise, Chris brought us a complimentary dessert of the goat cheese beignets with honey (complete with a birthday candle), which were sinfully good.Oh, and did I mention the wine? Chris talked to us about our likes in wine, and with his encouragement we splurged and each got a glass of Guidalberto 2012, a wine from Tenuta San Guido (the same Italian winery that makes the renowned Sassicaia wines). Omigosh, it was perfect! And we learned that Cru is also a wine retailer, with decent take-home prices on the wines that you find there ... and even occasional discounts offered.I highly recommend Cru, whether you're wanting a glass of wine, or dinner, or a bottle to take home. And we'll be back! (Oh, and I recommend you sign up for their email list too---that free birthday-week entree was an added bonus.)",5.0 star rating
"Went to CRU on a weekday night for our Anniversary. We were late and reached there at about 9:30 pm. I had called ahead to make sure they are open that late, the lady on the phone told me if there are customers. they would stay open till 12.- Smiling and Welcoming hostess and servers. Very good service and attention to details.- Ambiance is perfect for both, Romantic dinner and get-together with friends.- Great Wine selection, the 2 different Wine Flights we tried were good.- Food was not the best, though several Veggie options on the Menu always gets a 2nd visit from us.The nicest part, we were not hurried to get out so that they can close up, which was  amazing.

"My wife and I are  CRU fans and a member of their club. We have dined here before on special occasions with our family and my teens think it is a real treat. I booked a reservation for my family for Christmas Eve and was completely disappointed. We were seated and almost 10 minutes passed before our waiter greeted us. She seemed bothered to be working that night and was truly not suited for the hospitality biz! She said she was frustrated because it was a special menu and the kitchen has been screwing up all night (Gee thanks for letting us know!).  They allowed my kids to order pizza, although not on the menu that night. It was served 10 minutes prior to any other person's order and was the best think on the table. The Lobster bisque was luke warm but at least tasty. The Branzino was terrible!! Very bland and the roasted veggies with it were not any better. The scallops were OK but the risotto was cold and not very good. The desserts were nothing to write home about either. The sad thing is that we were really looking forward to this evening and had talked about it for two weeks. We will not return.",1.0 star rating
"One of the most disgusting restaurant experiences of my life. Got a bill of $93 for nasty dried out food made from low quality ingredients. The waiter scammed me into having a filet mignon butterflied because otherwise it would ""take too long to make"". They brought it out so fast along with appetizers that it must have been sent back by a less accepting customer than me. It totaled less than an inch thick stacked up and was like shoe leather. My friend ate the tuna tartar and was ill immediately afterwards. The appetizers were gross as well. Not a thing good to say. Can't figure why they were in a rush since there were plenty of tables open. It looked so nice but the facade hides a rotten, vastly overpriced experience. Don't fall for it like I did, this is a bust out joint that would have failed long ago if it wasn't in a hot tourist spot.",1.0 star rating
Cru wine bar is a perfect brunch spot. I've had a few of their dishes and all were pretty good. The crunchy french toast is good. It's like french toast coated in frosted flakes topped with strawberries. The steak and eggs is also good but the steak is pretty small so I don't think it's really worth the money. As far as I am concerned there is one thing on the brunch menu that is truly a gem and is not to be missed. Crab omelette. O.M.G. It is worth every bit of the $11. The crab is tenderly seasoned with a subtle yet mouthwatering flavor. The omelette is accompanied by roasted potatoes that are OK (need ketchup). Get the crab omelette. You will not be disappointed.,4.0 star rating
"My latest experience was less than satisfactory. I went during lunch and sat at the sushi bar, we looked at all the lunch specials and decided to go with 2 roll special which comes with salad and miso soup for $11.The miso soup was delicious but the rolls left an unpleasant taste in my mouth. They were rolled very sloppy (rice & fish fell out of the seaweed paper)We barely ate half of it and asked for our check. The waitress seemed perturbed and didn't even ask if we liked our half eaten meal. Bummer",2.0 star rating

"I came here on a whim, just looking for a late night sushi place near me to celebrate my birthday. I had no expectations and I'm not a sushi expert, but all of the food I ate was wonderful, and the atmosphere was fun.If you don't like loud music, don't come here on Friday nights, when they have a live DJ. I enjoyed the atmosphere and had a lot of fun hanging out for over an hour with my boyfriend, when usually we're in and out of restaurants pretty quick. And I loved that the salad with ginger dressing was larger than it is at most Japanese restaurants! The miso soup was good, and I don't even like miso soup typically. The chicken teriyaki was delicious, the espresso ice cream cake was heavenly (and huge) and the bottom of it was Oreo maybe? I tried the pineapple sake and although I'm not usually someone who gets a drink when I go out to eat, I really enjoyed it. My sushi roll was pretty good, I probably would've liked it better if I had asked for sriracha sauce with it.

"I dig this place. Which is good because I live practically within walking distance. Their reverse happy hour on Thurs-Sat is legit. Though the music is a little too loud for my tastes, but I'm an old fogie.The sushi is also pretty tasty, some of the non-sushi food is hit or miss. The kani puffs (crab puffs) are really gross, but on the other hand the tuna tacos are thebomb.com Really, this place is a win-win, especially at happy hour (reverse or otherwise)... except for the service. I feel like they're understaffed most of the time, so drinks take a long time, food takes a long time, food gets forgotten, etc. It happens almost every time we come in here during busier times. The last Thursday we were here they forgot one of our appetizers, brought us the wrong kind of skewers, our sushi came out waaaay after the rest of our food, and we couldn't even catch a nice reverse happy hour buzz because our drinks were constantly empty, even though we were sitting at the bar. If you're ok with mediocre service, definitely hit this place up, but don't go expecting the moon and the stars.",3.0 star rating

Super fishy smelling salmon nigiri. Unappetizing. I'm bummed because I really wanted this to be the spot.",2.0 star rating
Sure. This place is great if you like watching the waitress flirt with her boyfriend and completely ignore you. I'm actually sitting here right now with a group of 8 people - we put in our drink order almost 30 minutes ago and haven't gotten anything yet...and both the manager and waitress continue to walk by without looking at us. I think a flare may be the best way to get their attention.Also this place is freezing and I don't just mean the attitude of the staff. I'm pretty sure my nipples are cutting through my winter jacket right now. It's July. In Texas. None of the food has come out on time and we've waited for almost 2 hours. We keep getting one plate at a time. Not all at once. So basically my friends are fighting me off of their plates like a ravenous wolf. My girlfriend just found a bone in her sushi. A bone. Oh! Wait!

"Before tonight, I would have given more stars, We've spent considerable $$$ here, to the point where there are sushi chefs and servers who recognize us- even a server who remembered what I ordered the last time I was in. We bring a lot of friends and family in. Great location, as we're close. Plus pretty fresh fish, decent concoctions? Should be a 3-4 star- 4, for the service alone.But? The business practices of BarChi leave a lot to be desired. BEWARE: Don't EVER order from their delivery partner- Door Dash. The first time we did it (sushi and all, 2.5 miles away) it was OK, but took almost an hour to get here. Tonight? A nightmare. An order of nigiri favorites, sea weed salad and some soup, Delivery from partner Door Dash was 2 1/2 hours later...And what we got was dropped off by a rude delivery person who never once looked me in my eye, just turned on his heels and went back to his car. I buzzed in to check the order (very wrong), he was still sitting on my street. As I yelled ""HEY!"", he drove away- no way to fix that. Darn it...Somebody else got my order.Called for Barchi  manager, with a specific complaint, but of course...They were ""too busy"" to take the call. Could I call back? Really? LOL. I'm a local. This is Austin TX. You're just on my ""not"" list, from now on. I can make an end run around you, any day.. To a bit of their credit, Door Dash did credit me back my money, but really? I was left completely unsatisfied, with food I didn't order.  But hungry. So a critique of what they did leave:1. Soft Spring Rolls- gummy, flavorless and hard to handle. Perhaps 2 hours+ in a car does that. Or maybe that's just the way they are.2. Basil Fried Rice- Nice basil flavor, without anything else. Super one-note. Not good.3. Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken- fairly good. The only thing I got that even approximated ""decent flavor"".BarChi, you've made a big mistake, both with your partnership with Door Dash and by neither of your managers having the time to talk to me this evening. Too bad you were so busy doing your job that you forgot to do your job. Remember that one little thing- local customers? LOL.Money, off your table. Good luck. There's a lot of good people working there,",1.0 star rating
"This is one of the most bizarre places I've ever been.I came here w a friend one night because we were craving sushi but every sushi place closes at like 9 and this one touted late hours. That is an understatement, this restaurant is essentially just nightclub that serves food. It's dark, loud, and they have flashing, swirling light machines that move to pulsating beats remixed by a live DJ placed awkwardly by the front door. It is SO LOUD our waiter would have to practically touch cheeks with us just to hear our order and we were literally shouting at each other across a two top table. The sushi wasn't the worst (not the best though), but there were so many different rolls listed on the menu it turned into a paradox of choice. I can't remember the name of the cocktail I had, but it was also okay. This place is just so club. All their drinks feature flavored SKYY vodka or other (icky) novelties. If you like that atmosphere, this place will suit you well, but it's just not for me. I was just looking for a nightcap and some fresh fish. On a positive note the sashimi was really great. On a less positive note, the bathrooms were a total mess and not large enough to accommodate the space when it's full.",2.0 star rating

I've had the same waitress more than once & she just plain neglects her tables. Normally as long as the food is good I don't mind dealing with poor service but the yellowtail nigiri I had was extremely fishy & did not taste fresh.

"Reviewing: Happy HourWhat We Ordered: Spice salmon crunch roll, takoyaki, and lychee martinis (we all recommend!)Happy Hour Prices: Sushi ($1.50-1.80); Maki Rolls ($4.50-10); Appetizers ($2.50-8); Drinks ($2-8). Happy hour happens 3-7PM Mon-Sat, all day Sunday. Reverse happy hours: Thurs (10pm-12am) and Fri/Sat (till 1AM)So I know this place only has 3.5 stars, but I really think the happy hour is pretty good! My friend and I came here during a Saturday afternoon and the place wasn't too packed so we were seated immediately. The service was also pretty fast as well!FOOD: The spicy salmon crunch roll is like any spicy salmon roll you will get at any sushi restaurant - it was good but I don't have any high expectations because if a sushi restaurant can't get a salmon roll down, then there are problems. Moving onto he takoyaki (one of my favorite things to eat), it came with 5 pieces and was actually pretty tasty. It was filled with plenty of diced octopus and quite good! Definitely recommend it!DRINK: The lychee martini was actually one of the best I've had. Usually I feel like most places will drop a tiny lychee into my drink, but my martini here actually had a decent-sized lychee. The alcohol also was strong but not over-powering so they don't skimp on the alcohol.When I'm in austin again and looking for sushi happy hour, I will definitely be back!",4.0 star rating
"A friend, Kathryne B., wanted to try BarChi for happy hour. I thought I hadn't been but as soon as we walked up I remembered I had been here a few years back for a birthday celebration. Back then it was a Friday night and I was still a sushi chicken so I got spicy tuna and left it at that. This time I tried one of their specialty rolls - the chi roll. It was interesting with the peppered tuna. Kathryne B. got the Austin roll. Let's back up a bit. We ordered the pineapple infused saki because it sounded good ... but it wasn't. Don't bother. We also ordered the spicy edamame, the takoyaki and the calamari. I prefer the spicy edamame at Imperia. I was not a fan of the takoyaki - the octopus was super chewy. Kathryne B. ate it though. The calamari was just okay. The prices weren't bad for HH but it wasn't a favorite so I probably won't be returning.",3.0 star rating

"Another cool place in the downtown ATX to meet your peeps and have some fun. Bring your friends and big credit card.Last night's tally: $61 for one beer, one cocktail, two sashimi and one appetizer. Only in the ATX would people call that moderate - its ridiculous folks.Our bartender - we ate at the bar - was polite, fast and efficient. My date felt like he pestered us too much, but I don't agree. I've been to so many places in the A-town where they forget you're there once you sit down, so pester away mixologist, I'm fine with that.Prices? Way high. 2nd Street District high. Go forewarned.Ambiance? Nice. Really well-decorated and different.Menu? Expansive.Should you go? If you like sashimi or sushi go once just to to see what its all about.Two weird things from my perspective. First, as the night wore on, the crowd entering seemed to get younger and younger. I'm talking 16 year olds wearing very skimpy outfits and yes I think its weird to look at 16 year olds: definitely made me uncomfortable - where are their parents?Second, they don't really know how to manage drunks too well. Four guys sitting/standing at bar early in the evening (8ish) were LOUD, obnoxious and loaded. Who knows how long they'd been there. The bartender cut three of them off - the fourth was definitely smashed, so I didn't understand that - but continued to let them wander in and out of the place, be rude, and take up almost half the small bar. Strange.Another four guys came in (what is this? shift-change) who were drunk but not obnoxious (yet) and they got drinks and started to get loud too.

"Be careful if u have gluten allergy. Don't eat the wasabi, they don't use the gluten free one even if asked. The waitress and waiters here are not very knowledgeable. I am not certain about their sushi rice though. Overall, if u have strong reaction, I would avoid this place or just have normal rice and sashimi.Other than that, the food tastes good and happy hour menu is great deal.",3.0 star rating
"Sunday nights have 1/3 off bottles of wine.A little expensive, a bottle of la crema is $53 but less painful with the discount.The cheese trays are delightful!!! At $16 for 3 oz of cheese, they had better be :)I still just adore this place, the bartender/waiter worked his booty off and was Extremely friendly and accommodating.The flights of wine are presented in a really cool way and everything is served at the right temperature.One drawback at the downtown Cru at least: if you sit on the patio you have the stinky smokers walking by stinking up your ambience...The Cru at Domain is less likely to present that one factor.",4.0 star rating
"Dinner Party Pros(for Cru Wine Bar @ 2nd St, downtown ATX)As I approached my 30th birthday, my wife arranged a small dinner party at this venue. She left the pairings under chef's choice leaving some clues on our preferences. The executive chef rose to the challenge, along with the staff and put on an amazing dining experience. Warm and cozy ambiance along with attention to detail were highly notable. Most memorable was each pairing that delighted us at every course. We enjoyed a refreshing gazpacho, succulent scallop, latin-inspired grilled chicken, and crunchy rhubarb-blueberry crumble. Each accompanied with an array of fine moscato, reds, and whites.Truly, a classy farewell to my 20s,Cheers!",5.0 star rating
"I love going to Cru.  It's a go to bar for me.  I especially enjoy the happy hour but when on 2nd street and we don't know where else to go, we always end up at Cru.Saturday night was packed.  We stood for 15 minutes and finally got a table.  Our group ordered a bottle of wine only since we already had dinner else where.Christian helped us and he was nice and knowledgeable.  Came by to check on us a few times too.  Always a good place to go.",4.0 star rating
"My friend had made reservations at Cru for her birthday dinner/ARW for 8:45pm last Wed, but 2 more people showed up at the last second so the host told her that we would have to wait a little longer. A little longer turned into 45 min as they were waiting for a bachelorette party to leave so they could give us their table. The host would come by periodically to give us updates (""Oh, they're getting their desserts now!"" ""They just got the check!"" etc) which was helpful, but we were still a bit peeved at having to stand in the doorway for that long. It was raining outside, otherwise we would've asked to be sat there.As they realized we were about to leave because the bachelorette party showed no signs of leaving, they told us they could sit us in the party room in the back. Apparently they had not wanted to seat us there originally because they didn't have any servers available to cover that area/table. We were seated forthwith, and the host and server apologized profusely for the wait. They also comped us some calamari and potsticker appetizers, which was very nice of them. Almost everyone ordered off the Restaurant Week menu, and some standouts were the mussels, and the salmon. I had some of their creme brulee for dessert and it was amazing! The crust was perfect, and the custardy goodness inside wasn't too sweet. It was reminiscent of Whole Food's vanilla pudding. Mmmm. Despite the rough start, Cru made a great recovery and their excellent customer service and staff saved what would have been a disastrous night. I would definitely come back again. PS. Their wall of wine totally reminds me of one of the library in Beauty and the Beast. It even has a ladder that rolls. I wanted to climb up that ladder and have someone scoot me from one wall to the other...",4.0 star rating

On my most recent visit, I got the Spanish wine flight. I'm a huge fan of Malbecs and these wines, although not Malbecs, hit the spot. I also got the ""sinful"" cheese plate. It was a great compliment to the wine. These are quality cheeses, unlike some other popular wine bars in Austin (see my other reviews). I will definitely be back to try more!",4.0 star rating
"This review is based on a visit during Restaurant Week in October in which we were not impressed.  The food was okay, not special, and definitively overpriced.  If RW is supposed to put their best food forward, then this is not a restaurant;  it is a wine bar trying to also be a restaurant and failing at it.The table service was congenial while the kitchen was unforgivably tardy.  We had reservations at 6:15 PM expecting to have a leisurely dinner and walk over to Moody for an 8 PM show, but our entrees were served at 7:50 PM.  It was unusual that all four us got the same entree, a pan roasted chicken piccatta which should not be called piccatta based on its peculiar preparation and death by sage.  Being rushed to eat it did not help.  The crab cakes appetizer was just okay and quite a measly sized portion.We did not want to miss the show, so the manager asked us to pay in full for the set meal but come back after the show for our dessert, which we did.  Creme brulee was excellent but charging us for three coffees was bad form, considering we already paid up and were inconvenienced in so many ways.  In short, nice wine bar, nice environment, great flamenco guitarist on the patio, but food and food service sub-par and overpriced.  Too bad because it would be nice to dine there and walk over to Moody for a show.  But not this place.",2.0 star rating
"It was the last night of our girls weekend and we wanted to find somewhere special to have dinner. Cru has a beautiful, intimate patio that perfectly fit the bill. The staff was so courteous and friendly I kind of did one of those ""Me?"" and looked around to see where the famous person was they were being so kind to. We ordered wine flights, which came out w/ cool descriptive cards. We shared the cheese fondue which was excellent- served w/ pear, apple, bread, broccoli rabe, and baby red and yellow peppers. We also shared the pear, gorgonzola pizza that had honey and basil on it. What an amazing combination! The pizza could have been cooked just a tad longer, but overall was excellent. We had a great evening on the patio at Cru. I'm looking forward to going back soon.",5.0 star rating

"Yeah, it's a chain.  So what?I really enjoy this little bar, quietly tucked away in the middle of not-so-quiet downtown.   The wine selections are great, the flights are reasonably priced, and the food that I've tried went well with the drinks I was having.  But you can get nice wine and good nibbles anywhere.  Seriously, it's not that hard and everyone sells the same wine, so what makes one wine bar different from another?   Atmosphere.  And that's ultimately what I really like about this place.  It's almost always quiet and inviting and warm.  The music is never too soft or too loud, it simply fades into the background and you only notice it when you want to notice it.   The soft lighting makes everyone look good, and the ambiance is one of quiet class and sophistication.   It's a great place to meet someone for a date, or to meet an old friend to catch up on new news.",4.0 star rating

"I went here around 8 PM on a Saturday while attending a conference in town. We were looking to grab a decent dinner and some wine. The dinner aspect went okay, but it took a good twenty minutes for our wine flights to arrive as apparently they had run out of tasting glasses(?!). Our waiter was also fairly negligent, and water glasses sat empty for long periods between refills- a problem since there is no air conditioning or fan in the restaurant and it was about 90 degrees inside. The food was decent but with such poor service, I'd give this place a pass.",2.0 star rating
"We went there on Sunday for wine and appetizers.  It was lovely.  I loved the ambiance and lounging area....it was a perfect spot for getting to know someone.  We ordered the cheese platter with prosciutto and salami and the Italian flight.  The cheeses were lovely, although I didn't personally care for one, but that is just a personal taste matter.  The wine was great and I would recommend this spot especially for a lil romance.",5.0 star rating
"The modern, art deco design paired with a nice selection of wines and good looking menu was promising, however I agree that portions are on the small side.  We went for dinner during the week and discovered some decent happy hour options and nice wine flights with tasting notes.  I ordered a salad and starter for my main while my fiance has a beef dish.  The meat was very tender and nicely cooked, while the salad serving was paltry.  The food was solidly good, however the dessert was obviously pre-made and then not cooked properly (it was a lava cake however it was overcooked so the middle was not oozing as it should and it was not warm).  Our server was responsive and offered to bring another.Nice place to try, but I probably won't go back again.",3.0 star rating
"Note: I've been to both Austin-Cru locations, both were good, but I will be reviewing my experience downtown.The interior is exceptional, they have the perfect amount of dimness to the lighting that gives the bar a haunting glow.  Servers are fantastic.  Selection is pretty decent - I had the ""No Pain Like Champagne"" flight and my friend ordered the cheese plate.  Our one complaint: stale bread (even the crispy bread/chips mixed in could literally be BENT like RUBBER), but everything else served up was a diverse and delicious mix.A little pricey, but that's what comes with wine bars.  Great specials such as 1/2 off bottles of sparkling on Thursday (Domain location -not 100% sure downtown) and 1/3rd off bottles of wine (downtown) on Sunday.",4.0 star rating
"This place is very classy! The wine flutes are so fun, creative, and delicious. I wasn't all that impressed with the food though. I liked the grilled cheese and tomato soup but it was a little too salty for my taste. My group also ordered the fondue and it was a little on the cold side so we sent it back.

We saw our server maybe 3 times in which one of those 3 times.. we had to flag down another server to find ours.

"This place is completely insane. Went with my friend to have a dinner. Both of us ordered filet mignon and ginger ale. Got the food pretty quick, but meat and side were barely worm, strange considering how fast it was delivered. I suspect that food was just heated up in microwave. So it is time to pay the bill and we asked for a separate checks. At this point our waitress tells us that she already made the check and insists that she can't give us separate checks. We ask again and get the same answer. At this point we ask for the manager, she leaves and in 5 minutes comes back with two separate checks...So this place gets one star for food and no stars for service.Rest assure I would not be back again.",1.0 star rating
"This place would have been great of the food had come out correctly. Our appetizers didn't come out before our main course, but instead came out sporadically through the meal.

The place is nice. Clean. Everything tasted fresh. I ordered the big easy roll and the Austin roll. The big easy was very good. The Austin was better. I am only giving 3 stars Beccaria of the waitress. She tried to pull a old scam. The bill was $24.90. I handed 2 $20's. She gave me 5 $1's back. She should have given me $15.10.

"I am not a big sushi fan nor is my partner. We went here for dinner with a friend. When we first pulled up we were thinking to ourselves where did he take us because it looks like it was in a strip mall. But when we walked in it was completly diffrent. It looked like a vegas restaurant. Very nice and spread out. Their happy hour was amazing. We got gyoza for 3.00 we also got wings for 3.00 ( would not reccomend those) We orded the longhorn roll and we order 2 of them. They were absolutly amazing. Not only that but they were only 650 for happy hour. My other friend had the asparagus soup. She felt it was way over priced for what she got. It was 13.00 ( for soup? ) she then had a meat appatizer, i do not know what it was but she really liked it. I was done with my one roll of longhorn and my partner was finished with his. It was so good i had to order another one. It has been a week since we have been there an i have been thinking of it all week. Guess where were going for dinner tonight :)",5.0 star rating

"Hubby and I stopped by last week on our way to a friend's art opening for a quick drink. It was ""champagne Thursday"" so we were treated to a free taste of some really nice bubbly. That's always a nice welcome.We had been to a Cru before, and their concept is nice when you are just wanting to check out some new wines. However, the negatives for this place have to be 1.) the staff 2.) the decor. The waiter at the bar was fine- pleasant and quick. However when a second waitstaff came over to chat with our waiter he proceeds to bitch about customers right in front of us. Tacky! The decor is also pretty tacky. The cheesy painting of wine labels on the walls is poorly done and really cheapens the place. And don't get me started on the women's bathroom decor... It is a serious contender for Worst Bathroom in Austin. The black toilet with non-matching black toilet seat...ICK! While decor is not enough to make me dislike a place, the staff need to really step it up. If they are charging $15+ for what amounts to one glass of wine, they need to perform their jobs with that level of courtesy. Otherwise, it's just a joke.",3.0 star rating

"Cru is an ultra-cool wine bar in Austin's up-and-coming 2nd Street District. Like the rest of the district, it's upscale and likes it that way. Cru has a small, crowded interior that generally fills up quickly on weekend evenings with career-minded young professionals, couples, and residents of the AMLI Lofts. I'd recommend the patio...more personal space, better ambiance, and more attentive service. The wine bar and restaurant serves an interesting menu of gourmet appetizers and entrees. Their knowledgeable wait staff is very good at highlighting what Cru does best - their sharing plates and flights. While it's probably not a brand new concept, it's definitely a cool one. Cru offers ""flights"" of wine, which is basically a mini-wine tasting. Get a menu. Pick a type of wine. Try three glasses of different, yet similar wine (ie: three glasses of Pinot Noir, from differing regions). They also serve sharing plates, which is their way of letting you skip the, ""We are going to split the fried calamari."" Nice.I tried a Charming Chardonnay flight ($10) on their 2nd St. patio and enjoyed myself thoroughly. They offer tasting notes for each glass, so you know what you're getting into.Cru would be perfect for a drink and appetizers while shopping, or for a couple who has landed a babysitter for the night. Free parking at Austin City Hall (a short walk from 2nd St.).Cru Wine Bar is excellent.",4.0 star rating

"Hmmm....not sure what to say about Cru.  I liked it, I really did, but it's not anything spectacular.  I've been to my share of wine bars around town and have my personal favorite (the Grove), so I hold every other one I go to to that same standard.The service was slow.  It was about half full when we were in there (which was a Saturday night at 8:30!), but it seemed to take forever to get a wine order in, followed by even longer to get our dinner order taken.  Then it took a good half hour for our food to arrive.The prices were exorbitant.  We ordered the pizzas, which were $12 and $14, respectively.  They were personal sized, and the hubby walked away hungry.  When we go to the Grove, we can get a large pizza for $15, loaded with veggies, and we split it and still have a slice or two to bring home!  AND the pizza at the Grove is better.I'm not saying I won't go back....it's a solid spot on 2nd Street and if the mood strikes and we're downtown, I'd give it another shot.  But if I'm in the mood for a wine bar/restaurant to go to, I'll stick with the Grove.",3.0 star rating
"I love this place!!! Though I have never had the food, it is without a doubt one of my favorite places to go when I just want to relax and enjoy a glass of wine by myself.

We went there last night after a party at the Ashton and was pleasantly surprised!  It's perfect for a date night with the boyfriend or hubby!    We started with a glass of the Lamarca Proseco - but after tasting - we liked it so much and switched to the bottle.  The mussels were perfect - and the broth was excellent to dip the crusty bread in.  The 5 cheese pizza was the perfect size - and since I have an aversion to truffle oil (after a 8 course truffle dinner / incident) - they graciously held that.And the shrimp potstickers were yummy - very fragrant and tasty!  It was very nice to be able to choose 3 totally different appetizers and not feel guilty about it.  The service was perfect - very attentive.  And not just from our waiter - but from others in the restaurant.  Another server checked on our table after we got the food - and later picked up our check and ran the credit card for our server.  These guys have either put an emphasis on training - or on hiring experienced servers.  Either way - that's tough to do but definitely worth it!  I noticed that their attention to detail is what puts this place at the top of their game.  They have little votive candles in the wine bins that you have to climb a ladder to light them.  At 10:30pm - they relit them.  I found that very telling as most people would ignore such a small detail.   Nice job Cru!  And thanks to Priscilla our server!,4.0 star rating

"I first ventured to Cru during ARW. Some friends and I organized a ladies' dinner, and were very excited after reading the menu and wine listings. We started off with a wine flight, very reasonably priced. I chose a pinot grigio centered wine flight, at a reasonable $11.00. I truly liked all 3 wine selections, and they paired nicely with the courses (as suggested by the excellent server). The only complaint I had was that the main entree advertised the fettucine as including ""rock shrimp"", yet what was served with the pasta resembled something more along the lines of small cocktail shrimp. Unlike rock shrimp, which usually has a lobster-esque taste, these shrimp were tiny and flavorless.  Dessert was a fresh slice of cheesecake with a fresh raspberry puree glaze. The cheesecake was delicious, but could have used a tad more sauce to compliment it.Overall, it was a good dining experience.",3.0 star rating

"Really awful experience. We placed an order for delivery through Uber Eats. We ordered 6 juices and iced coffees. Someone called us about 20 min after the order was placed to say that they had to give us hot coffee because they were out of iced (?? Unclear, as they offer many items requiring ice). We paid for iced which was more $ but whatever. He repeated our order back and it was correct. Then 40 minutes later our uber driver texted us confirming that we cancelled the order. I called the juice place to confirm that we did not cancel. The woman said that they received a notification that it was cancelled but that was an error and in reference to a different order. She repeated back our order and everything was correct but explained that they were in a huge rush and it would take a while since the order now went to the end of the line again. No apology. Finally more than 2 hours later our delivery arrived (our poor uber driver had to wait there for our order). We were 1 juice short (after they confirmed the order 3x). They blamed it on uber eats and said that if we sent another delivery driver back (and paid again) that they would make the juice. No apology, no offer for a refund, and did not accept the responsibility for the error. It is Saturday and the woman said she would ask her manager to call me on Monday. Wish I could give 0 stars but the 1 star I guess would be for the quality - everything was really good.",1.0 star rating

"I've come here several times, and after today I won't be coming back. $12 for a small juice and a kale salad. Ok, fine, I've done worse before, and I've put up with the 10-15 minute wait while 4 people ""work"" behind the bar, because I'm trying to be healthy. Today, however, the juicer broke. Looked like a big industrial number, so I have to assume that was due to misuse, or possibly not cleaning it properly. The manager did refund my ticket, but only after trying to pawn off one of their ""cold pressed"" bottled juices on me. Then I get back to my office and have massive stomach cramps and, shall we say, intestinal issues. I'd normally chalk that up to high fiber content, but the salad had a label on it saying it was expiring tomorrow. So...$12 for no juice and a salad that made my guys explode. Neat.",1.0 star rating

"As an orange juice lover, I enthusiastically stopped in here today and was hoping to receive the same quality and customer service that i get from the juice box and soup peddler in south austin. There were three people working there and when I tried to banter and joke back and forth one girl, with red hair, was rude and sarcastic. I apologized to the gentleman who served me and still tipped as I felt like perhaps they didnt like me asking how great their orange juice was - perhaps I had accidentally offended them?! There was a girl with long brown hair who was super sweet and recommended the grapefruit juice bc their grapefruits were excellent quality. I decided to get the grapefruit juice and my total for juice was 10.83!!!! SUPER expensive to me for juice (regardless of size) that was, while good flavor, served at room temperature. I had to wait until i got home and pour it over ice as I like ice cold juice. I will say the gentleman working there discovered he charged me for a large and I got a small and gave me some free orange juice. Overall, I thought the customer service and juice was average to slightly-less-than-average and the price was super expensive. As a product of a small, local business, I never mind paying more for local - but I expect GREAT customer service and a GREAT product. This place was just meh at both and at a high cost for being in the trendy 2nd street district. I dont think I will return.",2.0 star rating

"After having just arrived for a one night stay I was in the mood for a steak and this location was only a mile from my hotel.  I had hoped the restaurant wasn't closing soon as I arrived between 8:30 and 9:00 but luckily they were still open for business.  When I walked in the smell in the entry way was overwhelming of cleaning products and dirty carpet but as I approached my table the smell went away.  I ordered the crab cakes appetizer, a house salad and a 9 oz ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes.  I asked the server what was the thickness of the steak and she said it all depended so I said I would have it medium rare.   The crab cakes were just ok - they weren't that hot temperature wise and the breading was just ok - they were lacking something - and the small amount of remoulade on the plate was disappointing - had the crab cakes been better I would have asked for more on the side.  The salad was ok - a bit watery at the bottom.  The loaf of warm bread was ok but the ""butter"" was really spreadable margarine which I don't like so it ruined the bread for me.  My steak came out and it was the thinnest rib eye I'd ever seen - it looked totally unappealing.  The server asked me to check the temperature by cutting into it and not surprisingly it was well done.  So she said she would bring it back and I told her if the next steak is the same cut then I'd like it rare.  Well the next steak was larger and thicker and it was rare - a little too rare for my liking - but I wasn't going to send it back yet again as it was 9:30 at this point and I was hungry.  The taste was good - had a nice char - but the meat itself wasn't that great of quality.  A manager came over to ask me if this steak was better and I told her it was and she apologized and said they had a new meat distributor.  Hmm what does that have to do with my steak being cooked right depending on the thickness?  The garlic mashed potatoes were just ok - I didn't even finish them.  They had an offer that if you donated $2.00 to a charity you got a $5.00 off coupon on your next visit so I took them up on it - but I'm not sure at this point if I will use the coupon.",2.0 star rating

"Don't come for the steak.We found a piece of hard plastic packaging in the first couple bites of our filet. If that wasn't enough, the temperature was completely off. Medium came out rare (meat was still dark red and cold). When we told the staff, they took the steak and returned 10 minutes later with some charred bits. What steak house does that? We got a bunch of sorries, but no compensation. Nothing off the tab.Staff consisted of deaf novices. Drinks were not refilled unless requested. We were told medium was ""red throughout"". I may look young and gullible, but honestly, I'm neither. An establishment that thinks they can give worse service to any group of people based on what they look like is one I would love to see go out of business.The only good thing about this place (and one reason we came back this chain's south location) is their shrimp cocktail appetizer with avocado and chips. It's similar to a refreshing cup of ceviche without the fish smell and flavor.In the end, I can think of plenty of amazing Austin restaurants (and steakhouses) to spend $23 a person at. Don't come here for the steak. The state of Texas should remove the ""Texas"" from this chain's name. It makes us look really bad...",1.0 star rating

"Ate at this place a little awhile back because me and my girlfriend are new to Texas and i wanted a good steak.  That is not what got.  I will say she had the Salmon and it was great.  But i ordered the Ribeye and it was terrible, the quality of meat was just bad.  I told the waitress this and she told me that they are in the middle of "" changing ranches "" where their Beef came from.  So i ordered another one and it was the same.  Its hard to say what was wrong with it, but it was just stringy and didn't taste good.  So the manager came over and talked to me, attempted to anyway.  He wanted to make it right, but didn't seem as if he knew how to.  I was annoyed at this point, so i took the Filet he offered me to go  ( which was decent).  So we are about to leave and i use the restroom.  I go to wipe my hands and there are no paper towels, i check the stalls to use toilet paper and the floors are covered in toilet paper, but there is none to be seen in the dispensers.  The bathroom was trashed!  So i sit back down waiting on the check and the manager comes back and i tell him this.  He begins to make excuses, telling me the bathroom's are checked every hour.  Well if that were the  case, then it would not have been littered with toiled paper and there would have been towels and paper available.  Needless to say, the whole experience was terrible.  I still have yet to find a good steak in Texas, i wish it weren't this hard to find one.",1.0 star rating

"Where to begin...This was my first time dining here, I have to say my food was good, my drink was ok, but the service was terrible. I was with a party of 12 so I understand that always makes it harder for the server and restaurant, but this was ridiculous. By far the worst service I have EVER experienced. Our waiter, Jamie (who I swear played the sloth in Zootopia), only acknowledged half the table for at least the first 15 minutes. Then, he greeted my half of the table with a 5 minute monologue that was mostly inaudible, only to walk away without taking our drink order. After finally ordering our food, dear Jamie went MIA for a while. Like I said before the food was good, but not everyone at the table had the same experience. In 2 DIFFERENT dishes, we found large pieces of plastic, it looked like a prong from a fork. The manager gave us his email  and said there wasn't anything they could but bring us dessert. Because Jamie was taking forever we decided to start the check splitting early. Our dessert took a long time to come out and all they gave us were 5 scoops of ice cream (small scoops!) to share between 12 people. The checks were by far the worst part. It took 45 minutes to get them. He kept getting one check completely wrong (3 times!), so my friend ended up writing it down the order for him to take to the register. My husband tried giving dear Jamie the check about 5 times but he never acknowledged my husband. Thankfully, they took off all the gratuity because the service was so lackluster. How Jamie got a job there blows my mind, he doesn't match the vibe of the place at all. Once again, the food was really good, but the service killed the entire experience for me. I will not be going back.",2.0 star rating

"It was hard to know what to expect at La Condesa, given the write-ups I saw before going there:  On the one hand, Texas Monthly has it in its Top 50 Mexican restaurants in Texas.  That's a heavy-duty accolade.  But, on the other hand, La Condesa's taken a recent beat-down here on Yelp.  Lots of complaints about prices and service, among other things.  Sounded like it was going to be an adventure.It was, but in mostly a good way.  Maybe we got lucky.  There were seven us, and given that this is yet another upscale restaurant dedicated to small-plates sharing, we decided to let our lead server set up a meal for the entire table, with us throwing her a suggestion or two.  This turned out to be a great idea, because she was enthusiastic about this project, and we got to try one or two things from just about every section of the menu.  The server provided for a very evenly-paced and balanced dining experience through this variety, and did a great job.And it was quite a variety:--Guacamole tasting (which came with some fresh salsas, too)--Hamachi ceviche--One of the masa deals with mushrooms and huitlacoche--the Arabicos (or seared venison) tacos--the El Kalifa (or NY strip) tacos--a carrots-done-four-ways dish--Brussels sprouts (w/ bacon & grapes)--Elotes, or the Mexican-style street corn(Damn, I feel like there are one or two things I'm leaving out.)For the most part, this stuff was fantastic, the vegetables especially.  (The carrot dish was the third carrot dish the wife & I had consumed in four nights in Texas, and the third that was totally different and yet delicious and imaginative.  So I must ask:  What the hell is the deal with Texas and carrots?)  The ceviche was pretty great, too--it was cut more like sashimi, rather than chopped up.  The tacos were less great--the venison ones were tasty, but were served cool for some reason that I can't remember--I suppose to highlight the bright-tasting Med-tilted garnishes.  The biggest dud was the steak tacos, which had crispy manchego and registered somewhat like Steak-ums.  (Of course, Steak-ums can be a guilty pleasure, but the only guilt in this case ought to be in spending $15 on two of those little things.)Anyway, La Condesa is indeed pretty damn expensive for what you get.  With two or three drinks each, and a shared dessert, we dropped $65-70 each, tax and tip included.  Obviously this is not standard-issue Tex-Mex, with its basic ingredients, but $12-18 dollars apiece for sometimes tiny servings of even higher-end Mexican-influenced fare adds up in a hurry.  Décor is slick and very much of the 21st century, but it may already be starting to date a bit.  Seating was very comfortable.  And damn, the AC seemed to be struggling on this May evening.  It was about 92 outside, and felt like about 85 inside.  That's too MFing hot for the Great Indoors in Texas.Our experience was mostly up, but the few downs make me think that the negative reviews aren't necessarily off the mark, either.",4.0 star rating

Service was ok, but after messing up the checks and not offering to help I won't be returning.

"Literally stumbled upon this place on a gorgeous Friday afternoon in Austin.  I finagled my way into their bar area and it happened to be happy hour...SCORE!I had a few of their margaritas and their almond and chipotle guacamole.The Alma Blanca cocktail was fantastic!  I've sampled my share of margs and tequila cocktails, but this one was VERY unique.  Its a slow sip cocktail, but potent with many layers of flavors.  I followed it up with the Margarita Condesa.  I thought this would be their version of a classic marg, but it was quite different and delicious, but then again any cocktail with pineapple and tequila is right up my alley.The guac with chipotle puree and almond slivers sounded a little sketch, but it was also fantastic!  The added crunchy layer to the creamy avocados and spicy chipotle was AMAZING.Service was pleasant without being overbearing.  The bar area filled up very quickly and there is a great patio that would have been fab since there was no humidity, but the inside space is pretty sexy too.  From my corner table i noticed Lots of beautiful people come and go in waves.  This seem to be a bookend bar for a fun friday night in Autsin.  Ages ranged from late 20's to early 40's -- in case you're interested.Condesa is a great place to sit back and enjoy the view while sipping a unique cocktail!",4.0 star rating

"Seems like they listened to the reviews about under-spiced and inattentive but not in a good way. We started with the tostada de atun. Our server said, ""Oh, it's a large tortilla, you can all split it."" It came to the table...it's a 4"" tostada and we each got...one...bite. One bite. For $14!! And it was so salty that it was hard to taste the tuna. Actually, everything was way over salted. (See under-spiced reference) Next, two of us ordered the fish tacos, two to a plate, that's it no sides, $13 bucks apiece. One of us ordered the ""chile rellenos"". These things resemble chile rellenos like tofu resembles a steak. Four TINY little peppers stuffed with QUINOA! Um, what? Last person ordered the cochinita pibil. Sigh. Again, SO salty. And weirdly sweet I guess from using orange instead of bitter orange which is more like lemon. And then the ""habanero escabeche"". Why is this even served!! I love really hot, spicy food but wherever those deadly habaneros even touched the pork, it was almost painful to eat. Now to the inattentive part. Our waitress came back so many times to ask if we were ready to order that we started to think we were taking up her only table. It was weird. Go away, let us look at the menu for a minute!Our bill was over $200.00 and only one margarita, two teas, one of us drank water.

"I downloaded the app just to write this review. Let's be honest, I went to the place with a friend after ATX Cocina was closed due to water damage. A lovely older gentleman recommended this place as an alternative and my friend and I went.The first time we went was nice. They have a good happy hour and guac. However, we had a disgusting homeless man sit next to us, whip out some panties, and try and flirt with my friend. ACTUAL PANTIES. It was extraordinarily uncomfortable. But the rest of the evening was okay.I figured... Okay that wasn't their fault. So we gave them a second chance. After happy hour with a few friends we get our bill to see that we were charged for ice. Ten dollars FOR ICE. It was marked as a separate line item. We asked the waitress what the charge was for and she said that drinks on the rocks had an extra half pour and that was the charge.They did not tell us when we ordered that we would be charged extra or that we would be receiving extra alcohol. It was tedious and the staff was condescending. She asked us ""oh you've never seen that before?"". No. No, I have not because usually it's in the drink price or we get a normal pour ice or no ice. Also, there is no need to be sassy just politely explain it. Even though there should be no need because the entire concept is absurd. I expect to be charged the price on the menu or I would have ordered it neat. Thanks.Needless to say after these two experiences I'm not going back.",1.0 star rating
"My friend and I arrived for dinner on a Tuesday night; the hostess was very sweet and worked to get us in as we did not have a reservation. Soon after we sat down, I informed the waiter of my allergy to tomatillo and guajillo peppers. Having eaten at other Mexican restaurants, I know these peppers are used a lot, but usually there is enough on the menu for me to work around my allergy. The waiter seemed surprised by my allergy and left to find out which salsas had these two peppers. He returned and quickly listed two of the salsas in the salsa appetizer as having this allergy, but then left before I could ask him to point out which was which--another waiter had to do that for us. When we ordered our food, the waiter looked at me and asked, ""And do any of these dishes have tomatillo or guajillo pepper?"" I was taken aback and asked, ""That is your job, I am not sure. Just let me know if there is anything I can't eat."" Sure enough, when we left the restaurant, I began to experience an allergic reaction to the food. Luckily my husband was there to pick me up and take care of me. While all the food tasted good (if a touch too salty at times!), my night was ruined by a waiter who did not take seriously my allergy. I understand allergies are a little sensitive now and there is suspicion that people might claim to be allergic to something when they really are not for a variety of reasons, but I can assure you that after spending most of the night curled up on the bathroom floor, I wish La Condesa had taken seriously my allergy!",1.0 star rating
"I came here Friday for lunch with some friends and loved it - not sure why the reviews are so low! I ordered the chicken tacos and was really happy with them. They make homemade wheat tortillas (I believe they made them) and the chicken is a bit shredded and includes an avocado salsa and super good jasmine rice and black beans on the side. My husband ordered the fish tacos and loved them as well. So juicy and fresh. The frozen margaritas were also very good and thick and icy, not super watered down like some spots. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the drinks took forever. Very cute ambiance and will be back for sure.",4.0 star rating

"I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and it was OK. For the appetizer we ordered the Guacamole Tasting which was a variety of 4 different guacamole's and chips. I really liked the seasonal recipe which was guacamole with strawberries on top, but it wasn't anything special. The other guacs were kinda weird for my liking-but my boyfriend liked them. For my entree I decided to go with the shrimp cocktail which was pretty good, but I don't think you can really mess up a shrimp cocktail. Lastly for dessert we got the Boca Negra and it was probably the worst flour-less chocolate cake I've ever had. I'm usually a huge fan of flour-less cakes but this one just seemed like they tried really hard to make a different and add too many different flavors. It was a bit spicy because it contained chipotle, but it also had caramel and a weird tasting banana. The dessert was definitely not worth the price. The service was also not the best. They weren't too busy but I felt like our waiter barely paid attention to us. Overall I'm glad I tried this over-hyped upscale ""Mexican"" restaurant but I will definitely NOT be back.",3.0 star rating
"Where do I start. Server said the queso if one should call it that was some of the best they've ever had. The queso came in a skillet no problem there except it was tasteless (remember the word) hard and greasy. Ordered the chicken tacos after eating one bite of the supposed ""best queso"". Pretty sure for all I tasted was cilantro def the most tasteless tacos I've ever had. At the end of the meal the ice water was the best thing going and sad to say this place doesn't hold a candle to Taco Bell.

"My hubby and I double dated with yelpwife Erica and her significant other - basically some of the best people to eat fancy food with in town! And this place is SWANKY. We arrived on a particularly windy day, STARVING. Luckily the easy tiger bread (and three delicious butters!) hit the spot while we waited for our food. Our table got the charcuterie board, pork cassoulet, several appetizers (including the DELICIOUS scallops), the belle vie duck, and the house made cream agnolotti. The duck bacon on the charcuterie board was one of  our favorites. My husband really enjoyed the agnolotti - it was stuffed with really tender braised oxtail. The duck was a bit different than I was expecting. I think it could be described more aptly as a ""duck fried rice""- so I found myself a tiny bit disappointed with the amount of duck I actually got. We ended the night with chocolat au lait (the Valrhona mousse was decadent and satisfying). The service was amazing - and the pastry chef even came out to talk to us briefly. She gave us her amazing story about growing up on a reservation, and how she communicated to her grandmother who didn't speak English through dessert. It was really endearing and thought provoking - kind of the cherry on top of our nice night, adding a star to our whole experience.",4.0 star rating
"I took my girlfriend there for brunch at Trace on Saturday, and we had a great experience! I had the Butcher's Burger and it was pretty darn good! The patty is super thick - maybe 1/2 lb? Possibly more. It's pretty big. So much so that I couldn't even finish my fries (also delicious). The girlfriend enjoyed her lemon ricotta pancakes as well. It's not a cheap place, but it's downtown and inside the W, so you don't expect it to be. All in all a pleasant experience!",5.0 star rating
"On a return visit, after having a near flawless 5 star dinner with fantastic service and great food, I was a bit let down by the 2nd experience.  While the service was still great, the food itself wasn't at the same level and disappointed a bit.  I ordered the Niman Ranch lamb with roasted winter squash and mustard greensThe Lamb itself was enjoyable and nicely cooked, if not a slightly small serving, but there were no mustard greens on the plate, and the winter squash was so incredibly over roasted that it was almost inedible, with an incredibly dry, mealy and unpleasant texture on the inside with a visible burnt exterior.  Pretty disappointing, unfortunately and my wife's pasta dish, the Agnolotti, which I had previously had, was also pretty under-cooked, beyond al-dente, with the oxtail still on the dry side, but with good flavor nonetheless.  The fries are very good, if not pretty basic, and the white cheddar soup potato soup is tasty as well, but I'm not sure about $8 nice.The Bread Pudding and Carrot cake were respectable, but I definitely preferred the Chocolate au lait from our previous visit, as that was a delicious dessert.A 3 star experience this time, considering parts of both of our main dishes were severely under or overcooked, which is disappointing considering I know they are capable of putting out fantastic food.",4.0 star rating
"My husband and I were treated to a lovely dinner by the Trace staff that was nothing like the mediocre brunch we had had just the week before.  Full disclosure: we were using a $100 gift card that I'd received at a Yelp event, which made it very easy to return despite having had a less than stellar previous meal.We were visited multiple times by Chef Jennifer, Food and Beverage Director Nadine and Pastry Chef Angel. We absolutely cannot wait for the update to Trace's menu coming out later this spring.  Chef Jennifer produces some amazing dishes, but they aren't all on the menu yet.We started our meal with Easy Tiger Bread (from the local bakery) served with a selection of butters.  This night the butters were beef, beet, and pureed chickpeas (aka hummus).  The bread was baked fresh that day and heated just before being presented to us, so was crusty on the outside and warm and chewy in the middle.  My favorite butter was the beet version.  We also had the seared scallops appetizer.  The scallops were nicely seared with a great goldenly brown color, and the sausage part of the dish provided a nice complement of flavor.Next came a special treat from Chef Jennifer, a dish with sumptuous pork belly served with sautéed veggies, half a boiled egg and an intense mustard sauce.  For its great mix of flavors and textures, my husband said it was one of the best dishes he has ever had.  We will definitely order this again if we ever see it on the menu.Our next treat from Chef Jennifer was a seafood and mushroom medley that consisted of a scallop, a shrimp and an oyster mushroom in a savory brown broth.  This was rich with flavor, and so delicious that I may have used what bread we had left over to sop up all the broth.From the menu my husband ordered the Pork Cassoulet, which is braised and roasted pork, toulousain sausage, navy beans and chicharon crumble.  The beans were overly salty for our tastes, and this was not as good as some of the off menu items we tried, so again, makes us eager for the new menu.I ordered the Grilled Kale Salad.  I loved this simple salad of grilled kale.  Grilling the salad added an extra savory dimension that made the salad really hearty and gave me the sensation of eating a meat-based dish.  Overall this is a very good salad, especially in the winter.For dessert Chef Angel presented us with the Local Carrot Cake Praline and the Johnson's Backyard Garden Beet Yogurt.  The Local Carrot Cake Praline sounded amazing to me with classic carrot cake, feuilletine crunch,  praline mousse, Johnson's backyard garden candied carrots, and carrot ginger gel.  However the taste was not as I expected from the description. I detected more amaretto flavor rather than the traditional carrot cake/praline/ginger taste that I was expecting.  This carrot cake praline was very good, just not what I expected.  Both by husband and I really enjoyed the beet yogurt.  It was light, creamy and sweet without being too sweet.  The pistachio micro sponge cake that is cooked to order right before serving was a great compliment in flavor and texture to the beet yogurt mousse.  This dessert was noted as a ""sweet feature of the week.""  I hope Angel keeps it on her menu as long as the Johnsons have beets.Overall, Trace really went over the top to make sure that we had a great dinner experience.  Although not every dish we had was a five star dish for us, the majority of what we had we loved, the service we got was phenomenal, and we're looking forward to coming back to Trace when the new spring menu launches.",5.0 star rating
"A few notes before I get into the details:1. I came to celebrate my wife's birthday2. I had a nice $100 gift card that Trace gave to Yelp Elite at a prior event3. I went on a Thursday night 8:15pm reservation.____5-star wait staff.  Jenna was amazing.  She was just very honest and personable.  We talked about being carnivores.  She would help direct our decisions and even when we were debating between taking one dish out over another, she was like - ""no, I promise you'll like this one more.Well, my wife and I ordered a lot. Golden Potato Pierogie- flavors were good, I thought the pierogie was a little hard.  I like mine softer.  The goat confit was good, but a little too dry for mePotato & Cheese Soup- standard, good consistent texture- this fell flat because the house made pretzel was burnt (black).  It was thin and thus easy to burn, but it didn't add any sweet or saltiness.  We only tasted burned black breadSeared Scallops- this was given on the house- a good sear, but just a 10-15 seconds too much.  The sausage and lentil were actually my fav in this dishHam Risotto- this unfortunately was the epic fail.  The poached hen egg - it was solid . . . As in i put my fork in it, and I lifted the entire yolk.  The white were light, but it didn't work.  When the floor manager came to ask how things were, I mentioned it, and she got me another one.   Well, the 2nd one . . . cold and hard as well.  My server Jenna was walking by with the manager when she asked how the 2nd egg was.  Before I said a thing, Jenna responded, ""That's just as bad.  Let me take that back to the chef""- We never got another one.  The chef came by to check on us later and apologized.- The cold 2nd poached egg made me think that they try to pre-cook their poached eggs, reheat and add it . . . always a bad choice if you're trying to keep the consistency- we could eat the risotto, but if this was the tartare - that would be horribleHousemade Cream Agnolotti- This was the star - great flavor all around- I thought the pasta was good - a little harder than al dente, but if I came back I would get thisPork Cassoulet- Lots of meat - pork loin was a little dry, pork belly was fatty and delicious, pork sausage was soft- Only down side was the grilled bread was a little too burned for meWhite Cheddar Gristmill Grits- Most amazing grits I've ever had- I was told they serve this all day- flavorful - it was like I was getting to eat/drink gravy all dayDessert- One birthday dessert (on the house)- One Maple Pot de Creme - Both great presentation.  Rich in flavor - try eating some of the maple with a bit of the chocolate and you have a winner____If you've got the $ and are staying at the W, this is an alright place to go.  Go with the Agnolotti and Grits.  The decor and staff were great, but on my Thursday night, the execution just wasn't coming from the kitchen.  I felt like I was at a friend's restaurant - nice people, but the food you appreciate because it's your friend.",3.0 star rating

"I went here for a yelp elite event and was given a gift card, which I used on a Sunday dinner service.The staff was really nice and bent over backwards to help, plus everyone seemed to know the menu pretty well. We also got a few things comped which was nice but may have been somewhat related to the fact that they knew I'd been at the yelp elite event. So, you know, full disclosure.I got the sweetbreads as a starter, which were really great. Honestly, this are probably the highlight of the menu for me and I'd definitely recommend them. I will order this dish on any future visits.For mains, I got the Belle Vie Duck and my date got the Lamb. She definitely out-ordered me. The Lamb was probably the best I've ever had. The duck, however, was not the best.Well, that's not entirely true. The duck itself was good. I've never had it prepared this way but I liked it. It was the rice it was plated on that I didn't like. Specifically, the duck cracklings in the rice. If you're like me, your eyes probably light up at the phrase ""duck cracklings"" because, seriously, who's ever heard of that? It sounds delicious, though, right? Perhaps it could be but not when served in rice. I don't know if it was the result of bad prep, if it was the chef's intentions, or if this is just the way duck cracklings will always be (maybe that's why no one has ever heard of them) but they were sort of soggy. The end result being that my rice had an undercooked texture, despite being cooked correctly. Soggy little bits of duck crackling feel like undercooked rice, it turns out.For dessert we got the bread pudding and the carrot cake praline. The praline, though very delicious, was not that carrot cake-y. Fans of the flavor of carrot cake might be disappointed. Fans of desserts that pretend they're veggies (me) will not be disappointed because it tasted pretty great. Same with the bread pudding, too. I think that Perry's is still the king of fancy-restaurant-bread-pudding in Austin but this is a worthy dessert if you're at Trace, plus it's got ice cream.Overall, it was a good experience but, personally, I'd skip the duck next time.",4.0 star rating
"Everything was pretty great at Trace. Our server Mary. Our cushy booth. Our foods & beverages (grilled kale salad, striped bass, hand cut fries, !!outstanding flourless chocolate tort!!, Chopin potato vodka). They catered to my dietary restrictions and questions that I and my dining companion had, and even brought us some hamachi crudo just because. If somebody asked me if I thought Trace was a good place to eat, I would recommend it. In the 2011 Austin Chronicle review by Kate Thornberry, she says: ""Although many restaurants in W Hotels worldwide are leased out to third parties, Austin's high level of culinary sophistication prompted the hotel giant to do things differently here. Chef Nadine Thomas, an ardent proponent of seasonal and local sourcing, was hired as executive chef for the entire hotel, and chef Paul Hargrove, a like-minded culinary star, was put in charge of Trace. A menu was designed that relies so absolutely on locally grown, pastured, grass-fed, seasonal, crafted, and foraged ingredients that a full-time position of ""forager"" was needed to seek out and obtain the rarest and highest quality ingredients to be found hereabouts. ""The number of people who are interested in, and even insistent upon seasonal and organic ingredients just keeps expanding,"" says Thomas. ""Once businesspeople and other travelers experience the difference, it becomes something that they are actively looking for.""Valerie Broussard, who holds the position of forager, is on a first-name basis with 20 to 30 local farmers and suppliers. ""I keep up with what is coming into season and how much is available,"" she explains. ""Our focus isn't just on locality, but on sustainability, practices, and standards.""Now all that being said - which I totally appreciate - Trace is a little pricey, so I probably wouldn't come here unless it was for a super special occasion. Whether you think they are overly pricey, even given their commitment to local foodstuffs, is a lengthier discussion that is beyond the scope of this text.",4.0 star rating
"I have to give these guys some serious love.  They took such good care of myself, my husband, and our friends and we had a wonderful Sunday evening dinner.For transparency, we had the 100$ Yelp Elite certificate.  I was impressed enough with what I tasted there to brave the trip downtown for another go.Here's where I say some not so nice things, probably for the last time in this review: this is not really my food-jam.  I can be picky about my food, and nothing on the main courses really sounded that appealing, and who takes a 100$ gift card to get a burger (though, now that I see the picture of it, holy mother of cheddar I need to get back to get one, they look amazing)?  I actually figured I'd end up picking at stuff, give my three friends a great meal, have a snack when I got home, and be done with it.Boy, was I wrong.  Everyone left the table fat and happy and excited to come back, probably ESPECIALLY me.Since I had free money, I ordered a potato cheese soup which was wonderful, a watercress salad which was nice and light and refreshing, and a cheese plate.    They brought us a gratis appetizer of Easy Tiger bread (oh, so good - carb loading for days) and three different butters, beef butter, beet butter, and red pepper butter.  The cheese plate had the best bleu I may have ever had, especially when combined with the sweet stuff on the plate.  I intended to share once I saw the size, but everyone else was so enamored with their food I only managed to offload a few crumbles in exchange for bites of theirs.I had a delicious chardonnay, and my friend had a fancy cocktail (sadly, I can't remember the name, and Trace's menus seem to be down on their website) that was very warming.  Something about a cold night?  Fireplace?  Something winter-y.  It was appropriate because it was damn cold.We were all way too full for desert but we had to try something, so four of us split the carrot cake.  Thankfully, it was very light and reasonably portioned, so we all got a few bites.The service was excellent.  We ordered SO MUCH STUFF and I think the only thing that wasn't 100% magical was a slight wait on a glass of wine because they were out of it.  Our server was super friendly and on top of his game, the manager came and talked with us for a while, and then the desert chef also came by and talked with us after desert.If you like fancy food, and want to pamper yo'self, get yourself to Trace.  (and also DEFINITELY hit up the Secret bar before or after - but that's another review)",4.0 star rating

In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm not a big fan of the W hotel.. It's fine, just not my preference to rub elbows with the hipsters who overrun the place... Having said that, we had a grand time and was definitely worth the splurge - it was a real treat, from the yummy crab cakes to the steak to the sinfully delicious desserts - we enjoyed every bite and were treated like very special guests! The host/mgr, Martin, was also a delight! I can't say enough about the experience - I will be back!!",5.0 star rating
"I came on a Saturday night with a friend for dinner. Service was very nice, no complaints there. The atmosphere was pretty nice too. Being part of the W hotel means having a swanky feel which they accomplished, yet for some reason it feels a little pseudo swanky to me. The food ranged from eh to really good. Nothing was amazing or mind blowing.What we ordered/shared:-Venison Tartar: It came with pickled apples, venison heart and barley crisps. It was bright and tasty and had no gaminess to it. This was our favorite from what we ordered.-Ham Risotto:  This came with a poached hen egg, pickled peppers and cheddar. This was the most disappointing of all the dishes we had. It really lacked flavor. I would have at least felt you'd get a hint of the cheddar, but it was no where to be found on our palates. Plus, on a cold winter night, a hearty risotto seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately it was not very comforting.- Housemade Cream Angnolotti: Over the angnolotti was braised oxtail, black pepper and pecorino. This one was up there with the venison for me. It was light and delicate while also being hearty and creamy. The oxtail was tender and not dried out either. - Seared Scallops: They came with cotechino sausage, lentil vinaigrette and cress. The scallops specifically were pretty good, but not exceptional by any means. The cotechino sausage that came with was great and reminded me of my childhood. I really liked the flavor from the vinaigrette too.- Apple and Caramel Bread Pudding: It was just ok, I've had much better bread pudding in town and beyond.I like the chef's mindset and creativity, but unfortunately, as a whole, I just wasn't wowed like I thought I might be. However, the presentation was well done. I'd say it was minimal, and artistic which I like.We each had two cocktails. I started with their version of an old fashioned. It had an earthy quality to it which was a nice change of pace, but it seemed a bit watered down and weak. I ordered a bourbon neat afterwards. My friend got their basil daiquiri and the French kiss; she liked both.The total for the bill was over $140 before tip and I was still a bit hungry afterwards so that was disappointing. I had a $100 gift card which eased the blow, but I probably would not come back for dinner. I hear their brunch is solid; I would give that a try.",3.0 star rating

"We had a lovely dinner at TRACE, and we were so appreciative of the folks at TRACE and Yelp for hooking us up with a nice dinner. We made a reservation on Open Table, and were seated immediately upon arrival. The specials for the evening included an 8oz filet, which they ran out of by 8 pm. Boo. Chatted with out nice server and discussed the menu, which was missing all of those lovely bites that I tried a few weeks before. She then asked Chef Jen if she could whip us up some of the shrimp, that is to be on the new menu, and she did! How sweet, and how delicious! We also ordered the Easy Tiger bread, which was sliced sourdough with three spreads: lard butter, homemade hummus, and beet butter (so yummy and hot pink... Loved it). The bread was warm and worth the $6 for sure. For dinner I had the Housemade Cream Angolotti, which was ravioli stuffed with cream and cheese and topped with braised oxtail. It was devine. Hubs ordered the Ribeye, which was, well, fatty. It was cooked perfectly, and there were some good bites, but looks of searching around and lots of scraps (which our dog later enjoyed). For the price ($49), the steak was not worth it. His dinner also included a potato-like cake, that was crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Very yummy. For dessert we shared the Apple and Caramel Bread Pudding, which was delicious. It could have used a tad more ice cream (either that or my husband needs to cool it on the ice cream scoopin). Service was good, although dinner came out slowly. Restrooms are amazing....personal little rooms in a hallway of restrooms. Parking is, well, you know. It's downtown.  TRACE is a fancy little spot with a great menu. I'm so excited for their updated menu which is set for after SXSW.",4.0 star rating

"Staying at the W this weekend and our package through AmEx Fine Hotels includes $32 per person per day for breakfast at Trace. This will more than cover breakfast here!The staff is very attentive and wonderful.I ordered the migas, OJ and coffee. The migas were $13. Coffee was pricey at $4. But still well within my $32 credit.The migas was served in a cast iron skillet that kept the food nice and hot. My only complaint was there was too much cheese on the dish. You had to scrape off a thick layer to get to the eggs. However, the tortillas in the dish stayed nice and crispy and did not get soggy, major plus in my book!The portion size was generous. I only ate half of my breakfast, making this a good dish if you like to share. I hear the weekend brunch is pretty good here with an interesting Bloody Mary.

"What a way to celebrate Thanksgiving. A quiet corner table. Close family. An amazing meal which far exceeded our expectations. The limited Thanksgiving meal offered several appetizers, three mains and three desserts. I chose the Parker House Buns - 2 perfect warm sesame-coated buns with an aioli with a kick, pickles and some of the best chopped beef. While we had to make our own sandwiches, the end result was succulent and exciting. I also got to taste the full-flavored delicious sweet potato soup. My main course was the short ribs in an intense beef sauce with pearl onions and small potatoes. Some of the best beef in Austin. The turkey roulade that others had was also very good. Finally, my cheesecake sent me into orbit and escorted me out the door in style. Now, we need to try their regular menu but my mouth is already watering.",4.0 star rating
"What a pretty place! I had brunch here with several friends on Saturday morning and just loved the ambience. Stephanie was our server and she was very accommodating with special requests from our table and her pleasant and patient service was stellar! She briefly shared with us the concept behind Trace-local and sustainable ingredients to make thoughtful food-then took our orders for $1 mimosas which, let's face it, was a HUGE draw for us. The drinks were yummy with a perfect balance of fruit juice and bubbles and not in a thimble sized glass for $1. My brunch companions had a variety of items. Stephanie had mentioned baked goods from Easy Tiger so I thought I would give the Danish a taste and I have to say they were only ok. So I ordered another mimosa and waited for my avocado and crab toast which was tasty (the addition of grapefruit was so refreshing!) minus the chilies because chilies are no friend of mine. My only complaint was that it was only one piece of toast, a bit meager. Others at my table had the crème filled French toast, the hoecakes and the Trace brunch patty melt which my friend next to me ordered and she could have done without the texas toast-too much bread.  Everyone enjoyed their selections and we definitely enjoyed our drinks. The outdoor patio looked lovely, but the heat was too much for my friends and I, but I made sure to thank the dj for the tunes playing! All-in-all, very enjoyable and I'll be back!",4.0 star rating

"So sad to be writing a negative review, but I can no longer recommend this place in good faith.I was in the early stages of developing a Which Wich habit, and was planning to set up the app and start ordering more regularly because this location is convenient and the food always seems healthy.But now I'm turned off after my bell peppers had produce stickers all over them.I didn't discover it until after I had already eaten some of the stickers, and my stomach had indigestion the rest of the day.Unfortunately the employee that I told about the problem just shrugged and said she was sorry.  There was no attempt to make it right, or comp a meal, or even care very much.  Just a lot of shrugging.It makes me worried about the the quality of preparation and afraid to return.Just means I need to shrug my way out of Which Wich.",1.0 star rating
I finally tried this place and I'm hooked.  It's hard for me to find places to eat a quick lunch because I don't eat sandwiches.   The lettuce wraps here are great.  Next time I'm going to try a  bowl.  It was under  $20 for both of us including 2 large drinks.,5.0 star rating
I ate here today and had a long piece of metal in my sandwich.   They didn't seem very apologetic at all and only refunded me for the sandwich.  I feel they should have given me the option to receive another sandwich at a different time or comp me my whole ticket. Discussing experience and will never eat here again.,1.0 star rating
"Decent, quick sandwiches.  I remember when they opened everything was $4 except the $5 wicked with extra meats on it, and I ate here nonstop for about 2 weeks.  I never quite got over that burn out, but still grab something here occasionally.  Sometimes, for indecisive people like me, having to select every little ingredient on the sandwich down to the salt and pepper is a bit too much of a decision, but somehow I always manage despite being passed in line as the more sure minded folks turn in their orders ahead of me.The sandwiches here are a reasonable size and price, and the quality is ok.  Nothing fancy about them, but you have a plethora of options from toasted to not, to types of bread, ingredients, sauces, etc...Better than Subway and good in a pinch.",3.0 star rating
"I went to pick up a salad for dinner. I guess I shouldn't get a salad at a sandwich place. Ice berg lettuce and a lot of the veggies seemed wilted and was not appetizing. If you add chicken, it is the deli meat chicken, not slices of chicken breast as most would think.For first timers, it can be a little complicated but you basically grab a bag and mark all the items you would like on your sandwich/salad. Overall not impressed but I'll have to back and the a sandwich.",1.0 star rating
"When they first opened, I was addicted.  I think I might have over indulged because now it hard to bear the thought of eating their food.  Even the smell makes me sick.When I was a fan, I always went for the Cuban. Pretty decent for a fast food sandwich shop.",3.0 star rating
"Comically terrible experience. Walked in with no greeting, but instead three employees practically yelling their conversation at each other over the restaurant. No pens in the slots for ordering. Like.... Seriously no pens. I've never even seen that at a which wich. This is what really got me - I was the only one in there and they took 15 min to make my sandwich. Look, I get it. It's 3pm, your rush is over and you want to relax. But I cringed everytime you put one ingredient on my sandwich and then stopped for a conversation. Put another ingredient on and looked around for a minute, etc. I know you're not in a rush, but Jesus this was the worst I've ever seen at a sandwich shop. When I finally did approach the counter I was met with ""it's coming"" before I even spoke. Never again.",1.0 star rating
"LOVE this place. Awesome ordering concept with the filling out the sandwich sack on what you want in/on your sandwich and then giving that at the counter. Very creative. Great selection of meats, cheeses & toppings and the breads are all fresh in house.We came in at the height of the lunch hour, and even though the line was almost out the door - it moved quite quickly and our order came up in less than 10 minutes. There are places to sit both inside & out and parking isn't too bad in this part of downtown if you have to drive over.

"I ate here twice when I was visiting Austin for a convention.  The first time, the food was good although I ordered a milkshake and it seems like it took forever to get it.  But, I went back a second time a few days later to find a hair inside my sandwich.  It was gross and I will not be returning anytime soon.",2.0 star rating
"Interesting place we wandered into because the BBQ joint across the street had a 90 minute wait.  (I noted that the couple in front of us did the same thing)... So, overall, the food was good, but the concept was a little strange.  More on that shortly.. I will start by saying the various salsas and Crab infused Guacamole was good.. not outstanding, but pretty decent.  There were four salsas and they mixed well with it.  The waiter said that the meals were more in the line of family style and they were meant to be shared.  We opted for a couple of different options.. Mole Dominguero was good, but why give 4 people 3 tortillas if its ""family style""... also had the El Califa* aka Steak Taquitos.  Not bad either but definitely not enough - the waiter did warn us to his credit, but we weren't that hungry after the quac and chips, but still, this was a small portion for one person let alone 4.   We ended up ordering another of the Mole dishes and that sufficed.  I would just suggest they ditch the ""family style"" concept and they will be better off.  Food did not disappoint. Picture of the El Califa to follow.",3.0 star rating
The ambience is really good but the food falls a bit short. The queso flamado is brought out on a plate so it hardens up and tastes like cold rubber - would expect a hot skillet at least. The Chicken Mole is very bland. The chicken is dry and not marinated and the mole sauce is average. The ceviche is pretty good.,3.0 star rating
"Ive heard a lot of buzz over La CondesaSo finally i came around to trying it.It was very underwhelming, everything was on the pricey side, and nothing really stood out from our meal. I had the tacos with steak, i the steak was bland so all you could really taste was the cheese crisp they had on it. i think it was called el califaI also had the elotes, and was pretty excited for it, but it also needed a little salt, and definitely not worth the $5.The ambience and the service was really nice though. Our server was attentive and friendly especially since we had a birthday. The decor was really posh and modern, very fitting of downtown austin.",3.0 star rating
"Really very disappointed. Took my cousin from Los Angeles there along with her best friend from New York and it was a complete let down. The restaurant was too warm, the wait staff was inattentive, arrogant and all around bad and the food was just okay.  For example, I asked what our waiter would recommend and he arrogantly commented ""well maybe something from the left side of the menu and then the right, like a taco or something"". It was a joke. Truly a let down considering how many other places we could have dined instead. Don't go",2.0 star rating
"Stopped by prior to a show at ACL.  Got 2 cocktails and 3 small 'tapas' style dishes.  The food was fine but underwhelming.  I found La Condesa to be over intellectualized, uninspired, and a very poor value for money.  If this was smack dab in Manhattan I'd still be a little irked by the price to value.  Would it return nor would I recommend.",2.0 star rating
"Ambiance: The location and interior of this restaurant saves the rating. I love how bright and colorful it is, perfect for Instagram pictures. Laugh if you like, insta-ratings should be a thing. Cuisine:I don't think there is anything special about the food at La Condesa. It's good food for sure, but the price point is a bit high for the portions and quality. I have yet been for brunch, which they are known for. It was good enough to try again and maybe edit my rating. Service:I tend to give staff the benefit of the doubt, so when I say the service was bad it's pretty serious. I would say the service was ok erring on the side of mismanaged.",3.0 star rating
"La Condesa is something special. The interior is basically how I'd like my dream home to look, and the menu is unique, delicious, and pricey. Some of my absolutely favorite things are... Watermelon and Elderflower martini- one of my favorite drinks in all of Austin! Sweet, light, and delicious Tostadas de Cangrejo- these little tostadas had a HUGE amount of delicious crab meat on them. Awesome. El Califa Tacos- wonderfully seasoned with an awesome crunch and flavor from the toasted cheesePollo Rostizado tacos- also wonderfully seasoned with a milder flavor. The tacos are also pretty nice sized so they are well worth the $9Arabicos Tacos- again, awesomely seasoned. The flavors and textures just go really well together. Coliflor a la Plancha- Yep, it's a cauliflower steak for $18. It may be kinda hard to wrap your head around that, but what they do to that cauliflower is amazing. The multiple sauces and the way they cook it are so good! Pulpo- this is a giant octopus leg, but holy crap they cook it so it's all crunchy and delicious on the outside and the spices are incredible! It was a little chewy, but the flavor was fantastic. Service is always very good, but I did have a super snooty waiter once. He got a little pissy when we wouldn't order more than 1 thing each. I thought it was funny, but he was also pretty rude. Everything was still great! Things that aren't really my favorite here are the Hurache de Hongos- I didn't think the mushrooms had very much flavor Huitlachoe vida de Camaron- The ceviche was a bit too watery and it had a bit too powerful of a cocktail sauce flavor for me",5.0 star rating
"I read about La Condesa's happy hour from different websites and blogs. It is located on West 2nd Street, not too far from the main downtown area.The atmosphere in the restaurant was pleasant with outdoor seating as well. The happy hour area was VERY crowded after 6 PM when we arrived. It had the bar section, some seating and small outdoor patio seating as well. We got lucky and scored two seats at the bar. I ordered the Margarita La Clasica and my boyfriend got Margarita La Condesa. We both liked the classic better. It was sweet without being too much and very strong - beware. We also got the happy hour salsa samples which featured 4 types of salsas with chips. We both enjoyed this! This was a good experience, but due to the wait time for a real table we did not eat dinner here.",3.0 star rating

We had a party of 7 that was seated outside; it was after a earlier rain and water was dripping on those of us sitting on the long bench (they warned us about it), but the original seating arrangement had us sitting in a line; it's a ""party"" of 7.

"Good margaritas, mediocre food, terrible service.  Things got off to a bad start when trying to call for a reservation the night that we wanted to try La Condesa for dinner.  I called to find out whether they had any tables available and was told that despite the fact that they were slow, they could not take my reservation.  They stop taking them at 5 pm every night.  Brilliant strategy - you wouldn't want to lock in guaranteed new business, right?  I went anyway because I had told my girlfriend about my experience with their margaritas the night before.  That was my biggest mistake.All the dishes showed potential but were small and poorly executed, especially for the prices being charged.  Bland and small guacamole served with an overly large bowl of chips (no additional suggestions from the waiter about what to do with the rest of them).   Tortilla soup with undercooked and fatty chicken.  Huaraches with interesting toppings but overcooked crust.  Brussel sprouts with bacon that would have been good if they had left them in the oven long enough to be soft and have a char.  Supremely average chicken tacos.Service was lacking in many ways.  The low light was when the waiter essentially did nothing about the inedible chicken in the tortilla soup. I will never come back to dine, but may return for a margarita at the bar.  Their staff has a lot of work to sustain their food business.",2.0 star rating

"I've been to La Condesa a few times over the years and I always enjoy it, but I no longer feel blown away or wow'd.  I recently went in for a friend's baby shower and was underwhelmed by the family style offerings.  Some of the items were good, I enjoyed the guacamole and salsas, but don't really dig the thick tortilla chips.  The flautas were pretty good, especially paired with the salsas.  The eggs were an over cooked disaster (when will kitchen staff understand the creamy goodness of a french style scramble), the Modelo negro braised beef was somehow bland and tasted like crock pot cooking, the quinoa crisps were like eating legos and I thought the rice and black beans was an odd morning pairing, but that's just me.  I do love the specialty drinks, so HH is still a possibility.",3.0 star rating
A tad hipster for me however the service was good and the food was interesting.  They had a selection of ceviche and ours was good.  The fish tacos were good and the side of guac was very good.  I always love when I can get plantains and they delivered these fried.  Also an interesting and tasty selection of deserts are to be had.,4.0 star rating
"I brought my mom and sister here when they were visiting Austin for the first time. We immediately noticed the ""red snapper"" tacos on the menu, and as avid fish taco fanatics, we all ordered the same thing.

Cold cappuccino for which we waited 15 minutes (and one instead of the two we ordered,) the sweet-but-absentee waiter who never checked on us, and a manager who said, ""Yes, the speakers in the patio are really bad"" but blared the worst bubblegum music ever... well, they were nice but the experience was just not enjoyable. Actually... it was worse than that.",2.0 star rating
"I like this place a lot, especially for brunch, but I have a good experience only about every other time going.For starters, if they aren't busy this place is great for groups.  They won't sit you until your entire party is present, however, which drives me nuts considering how late my friends usually are (guilty, also). Their mimosa and Bellini specials are awesome, but the Bellinis are definitely better tasting than the mimosas, which are mixed in a container ahead of time so they tend to lose their bubbly.  This past weekend, I went with some friends for brunch and something came up right after I ordered so I had to run.  When the food arrived, I asked the person who delivered it to the table (who was not our server) if I could get a to go box.  I also asked for my check early because I had to leave and gave her my card.  My friends had asked for another round of mimosas as well.  She said she would let our server know.I got my food boxed up within 10 minutes but it took at least 15 minutes for our server to come back with my card and check, by then, we asked the status of my friends mimosas and the server said he had no clue about them.  The entire time, the server was very short with us and clearly did not want to be there.  I was also disappointed about how being in a rush to leave was not a priority to them. The biggest annoyance about the entire day was how I was asked to show my ID at least 3 times.  While we were waiting for our table at the bar, we ordered a round of mimosas.  Despite having an empty glass and never even leaving the bar area, when I asked for a second, I was asked to show my ID again. By the time we sat at the table and ordered a third round, we were asked to show our IDs a THIRD time, despite all having empty glasses.  I understand the need to check IDs, however asking at least three times in one sitting is excessive.",3.0 star rating

Had the Terverna Hash and Poached Eggs with Hollandaise sauce.   It was pretty good.  The Chicken and Waffles not on the menu according to my husband was pretty good too!  The Boody Mary's need a little help and are bland.  The atmosphere is relaxed and chill for a Sunday.,4.0 star rating
"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS ONLY BASED ON DRINKS. Me and my husband stopped here while in Austin and only ordered drinks. I ordered the RumPLC and he ordered the Mint To Be. We both agreed these were the worst drinks we have ever had anywhere. Lack of flavor, over-powering alcohol, very flat, and very small glass for the price. I would have ordered another drink in case we just had bad ones, but after the first I could not bring myself to pay for another round here. Atmosphere earns one of the two stars. Small but nice place with a seating area by the bar for conversations. Would I go out of my way to go back here for something other than drinks? Maybe, but wouldn't try too hard.",2.0 star rating
"Ok ok ok, I've had this place on my radar to do a review for quite some time as I've been going to it for roughly three years so here it is!I've had dinner, lunch and brunch here and each time it is a different experience. I refuse to judge this place by its craptacular wait staff because it is about the food and ambiance after all. Dinner, this place has charm, something unique about it that stands apart from other Italian restaurants. I've had two dishes here, risotto al pillo e balsamico and the vegetarian pizza. Both did not disappoint! The pizza was well cooked, timely in delivery and wasn't too large (good for sharing). The risotto was perfectly cooked as well, especially the chicken!The lunch, probably the worst wait staff available for this shift, but the food saved it. I had the Taverna salad, I know salad...boring. But it was delightful! I added salmon and the fish was done to perfection. There was a great balance of various veggies, especially the artichokes. I would do this salad again. For brunch, $2-3 mimosas are worth noting. They have orange, pineapple, cranberry and grapefruit for flavors, and they don't skimp on the champagne! I've had a few things here, I recommend the beignets for sure!!! The cappuccino sauce is delightful and oh so sugary sweet in the best way. I've also done the French toast, breakfast calzone (special menu item), chorizo omelet and eggs any style dish. They don't mess up brunch, in fact they shine. Make this a brunch stop for sure!!The expansion they did recently is also a nice touch as they made the right spaces more workable. Will definitely keep this place on my continued radar, almost a staple but not quite yet.",4.0 star rating
"Do Not Recommend!!! Some friends and I are in Austin for a bachelorette party. We came here (hoping for brunch, forgetting that it's Friday-oops) and since it was raining we decided to stay and have some good Italian. The staff took so long to wait on us-and was super rude when they finally did-that we got up and left. No need to waste money on mediocre food with terrible service! The bride to be left her phone there so when she went back to get it, maybe 15 minutes later, they said it wasn't there-didn't even look for it until the bride told her to. She was clearly annoyed that we had left so when she mentioned it to the bride, the bride said yes we did and this was why (slow, rude, etc). No apology or anything!

"I was excited to try Taverna after checking out the menu online. I could eat Italian food every day for the rest of my life and be completely happy. The hosts at the front were very welcoming and offered to seat me as soon as the rest of my party arrived. We grabbed a drink from the bar and were immediately seated. Our server came by a few minutes later with waters and said that he'd be right back. When our server returned, we asked some questions about the menu and he told us, ""I can't hear you"". No big deal, it was loud as it was a busy lunch shift. I'd prefer a more professional, ""I'm sorry, it's a little noisy, I didn't hear you"", but whatever. When we ordered our food, we ordered a round of drinks. He unapologetically stated that we needed to finish our drinks before he would bring us more, as that was the policy. We can't have two drinks in front of us. I understand serving alcohol responsibly, but there is definitely a tactful way to do this. Our server made sure to remind us to finish our drinks with each subsequent drink order. I'm giving three stars because the food was fantastic, the drinks were decent (and cheap) and the host staff was welcoming. I just wish that our server had been friendlier.**UPDATE The General Manager reached out to rectify the situation. I'm going to be giving Taverna another try. I hope to give this restaurant 5 stars.",3.0 star rating

"I don't know what it is about Taverna but I feel like LMFAO and very tempted to yell Champagne Showers, over and over again.Whenever I'm visiting good ol' funky Austin this has been my go to Sunday Funday brunch spot. It might not be a crazy setting but this is my cup of OJ. Trust me... I know how serious Austinites take Sunday Funday.If you forget to make a reservation (which I happen to do all the freaking time) walk on over to the bar and enjoy some class-ee* bellinis and mimosas while you wait for your table.*class-ee is a reference to a Flava Flav contestant who represents these $2 elixirs quite perfectly. Their intentions are good and meant to have some elegance to the experience; however, they can get you cray cray if you don't pace yourself.I've had my Lindsay Lohan moments and looked a tad bit like 2007 Britney and my dapper moments feeling like George Clooney. $2 Sunday Funday drinks can definitely get you feeling like you're a million bucks buying drinks for other people.The food here is quite delicious and I can't get enough of their chicken and waffles with the mango marmalade. The chicken is seasoned so beautifully with a nice crispy, tenderness to the crust. Paired with fluffy, buttery goodness us Texans prefer in our waffles- you can expect a dish brought down from the Gods.I also love their pizzas and the brick over crust they feature. Their food offerings has quite a nice range and will have something for everyone.Make sure to sit out on their patio, if possible, and take in the Austin view and see the rustle and bustle of downtown.",4.0 star rating

Both times when we asked for recommendations the food was INCREDIBLE- Fiocchi al gorgonzola e pera- pasta stuffed with pears and gorgonzola. Holy moly that dish was so decadent- the pears were sweet and subtle but strong enough to stand out with the creamy gorgonzola. The special- grouper with baby octopus, potatoes, and tomatoes. That grouper was melt in your mouth fantastic. And the flavor and texture combo was delicious and just blended so well together! It is a very beautiful restaurant, and it really takes you to Europe!

They found a way to make Easy Tiger bread EVEN BETTER.Only negative of the evening, and it isn't even major, was that we also ordered the scallops/sausage plate and it had only 2 scallops on it. One for each I suppose. Small portion for that app, but it was the best scallop I ever had.Our main dishes were the quail and dumplings with the duck plate. Simply delicious! The quail was some of the best meat I have ever had in my life and those dumplings were no joke! The portion was perfect for 1 person and the flavors still make my mouth water.Followed up with the caramel bread pudding for dessert! We were stuffed and in such a food happy coma! The bill for all of this? $113 ( including our beers). That is some of the best pricing for that high quality of food I have ever seen! Short note: TOP 5 fancy dinner nights in Austin!

Their food ranges from $3-$5 and their cocktails are $7. Bottles of wine are also 25% off! I had their sangria and 'summer in sonora' (basically, cue tequila) and it was all amazing. Space is gorgeous, noms are well priced, and you can just head inside for the W's happy hour when the Trace HH is over!",4.0 star rating
"Brought my parents here for their first visit to Austin and it was awesome. They just implemented a new menu the day we went and they MUST keep it. We all shared the quail gnocchi and a cheese board and we split two entrees: the salmon and the hangar steak. Great service, awesome new menu.",5.0 star rating
"Solid fan of Trace, specifically for breakfast/brunch. I've been going for years now and I recommend it for many reasons including fantastic service. You will be beautifully served by sweet, helpful folks - always memorable and notable service. For example (1) on Valentine's, my gf's steak was too rare and we were served a free half bottle of Veuve while we waited. SWOON. (2) anytime the food is not to your liking, they take it off the bill. I've also had many mimosas mysteriously disappear from my bill but that may just be a mystery unsolved. Let's talk food. Anything you order on the breakfast/brunch menu from waffles to migas to America breakfast to salmon will be delicious. The sausage and bacon are often unpredictable in quality so I give you that warning. The eggs are always perfect. The migas, truth be told, are what I call ""the most gringo migas ever"" but they are still delicious in their complete whiteness. Ask for extra salsa. I also recommend ordering a biscuit extra with whatever you've ordered and their homemade jam (DREAMY). Lunch I haven't had in a while but it was pretty solid. I had the Valentine's menu for dins this year and it was 2/3rs delish and unusual and 1/3rd boring; which is not bad when it comes to a Valentine's meal! I'm more of a brekkie guest.WINE. Let's talk wine. The mimosa they serve is the best mimosa you'll ever had. It's not $2 like the neighboring Taverna, mind, but you're not going to be disappointed (I am very disappointed by $2 mimosas lbr). Their wine list is very respectable if pricey. I've never had a glass of wine at Trace and been like UGH WHAT IS THIS; it's been more like ""oh, this is quite nice and classy as hell."" More review tiemz: Trace is classy af and it's adjacent to the classiest series of bar areas including their vampire-esque red room and the Hannibal-esque lounge with a beautifully burning fire. It's classy af and very inspiring if you're an artist of any variety. In conclusion, I'm a fan and hope you try Trace out. Tell them Liz sent you.",4.0 star rating
This was a solid breakfast. I had the shrimp and grits. The grits were very creamy and flavorful. I truly enjoyed them. The sauce with the shrimp was limited. I would have liked more of the gravy and I would have liked more heat. The wait staff was friendly and the atmosphere was pretty. I was a little confused as to the front door given it didn't really look like door and the restaurant had a hotel entrance as well.,3.0 star rating

"Just had a great breakfast at Trace, large portions and good coffee. Two (2) of us ate and the waiter added an 18% gratuity.  Since the waiter did not provide a pen with the ticket for me to charge, ( I did try to unsuccessfully  flag him down for a pen) so.... I pulled out cash but was .14 cents short, so I minus the .14 cents from the tip, left cash and walked out. The waiter literally came out the door and said I owe 14 cents, I told him, since you didn't bring me a pen to sign & charge, I took it off the tip and he said ""no, you have to pay it because the 18% tip is mandatory""! So he now gave me a pen to sign and charge the 14 cents of his tip!  I would have given him 20% had he brought me a pen in the first place. Crazy thing ever for pennies!!",4.0 star rating
"This place has been on my list to try for a long time and now Im kicking my self in the ass for not coming in sooner. My friend and I went in for a belated bday dinner and we had such an amazing experience. First of the space is lovely, inside and outside seating, very spacious and not loud at all. The menu had so many delicious choices to choose from so we ended up getting several I mean several(5 small plates) and split an entree so we could try as much as possible. Oh and dessert, we had two and what a fabulous way to end such a great meal. The service was impeccable and everything could not have been any better. I highly recommend visiting Trace! Im adding Trace into my rotation of frequently visited restaurants! I can't wait to come back.",5.0 star rating
"Jenna our waitress was excellent, keeping us all comfortable and enjoying this special dining experience. We ordered a variety of dishes which were all excellent and savory. The grouper was to die for and very delicious. Natalie, the restaurant manager came by to make sure we were satisfied as my family had taken me out to celebrate Father's Day. An even more special treat was from Will who came over and spent time to explain the aging process of bourbon. We were so grateful to have sampled the cherished bottle of 23 year old spirits. Wow! Amazing! If you are ever in the downtown Austin area, make a stop at the Trace.",5.0 star rating

You can't find a better patio setting in Austin. Thank you to Zane for being a perfect server & for the restaurant management team for their attention to our table - you made us feel so welcome!

"I had a fabulous meal here a few weeks ago, one of the best lunches I have had in awhile. I was shocked with how few people were in the restaurant for lunch, especially because they have a lunch special. The only disappointment was having to park at The W and pay for valet, no one wants to pay to park for lunch! My coworker and I enjoyed two different dishes and an aggressive amount of ice tea and finished things off with a nice latte. I look forward to coming back to explore more of the menu at Trace.",4.0 star rating
"This is only reviewed for a quick beer around 5:00pm, but I wanted to review because I really loved the atmosphere. The design is modern but not too harsh and is a surprising and eclectic mix.

"After my meal at TRACE I think of TRACE as a really sharp dressed hot guy who just doesn't have much to say on your date, the inch deep type.  Let's go outside to in.  TRACE is a gorgeous restaurant, well appointed, super fancy, very chic. You know, hot guy with the a Baume and Mercier watch, Pink tie, in Barker Blacks.   You can't ask for more as far as ambiance.   When we walked it it took too many awkward moments for the hostess to stop talking to the bartender and acknowledge we may like a table, awkward.  You know, hot guy who keeps checking himself out in the mirror after he asks you your life story.   The waiter was nice enough, our drinks were never empty but it's not like New Orleans, where being a waiter is a profession an they always dazzle you with an unmatched level of service.  I'm realizing now I suppose I may be spoiled.   Sorry hot guy, this isn't my first rodeo.The crab cakes were very good but for $16 to get three quarter sized portions was kind of surprising (in the bad way).  Unfortunately, I haven't found a crab cake that compares to Truluck's.  Blame them, TRACE.  The ribeye with the potatoes was good but nothing I haven't had before at other steakhouses, pretty standard taste.  The purple potatoes were actually super cute and the only surprise of the experience.  You know, hot guy telling you he volunteers to read to children on the weekend (who could have guessed).All in all we decided we were glad we tried it but it would never be a place that we'd choose to come back to given all the other watering holes in Austin. You know, hot guy, don't call me. I'll call you.",3.0 star rating
"Came here for breakfast when I checked into the hotel and was very happy with my meal. We came in from the hotel lobby and had to take about 5 turns that looked like we were walking into nowhere, but we finally made it, got seated and was that much closer to breakfast.They actually have some pretty great breakfast options and something for everyone. I settled with the waffles and the table shared the corned beef hash. I loved my waffles. Nice and crispy with some fresh strawberries on the side. Your basic waffles, can't really go wrong. The corned beef hash was good, but it's your fancier upgraded version. With real pieces of steak and large chunks of potato, the onion and peppers just made the dish super flavorful. Definitely a bit too small to fill you up, but perfect for sharing with the table. All in all, great service, quick delivery of our food and it was delicious. Definitely worth coming if you're looking for a bite to eat.",4.0 star rating
"Just had a WONDERFUL breakfast at TRACE. Unfortunately, I will be leaving town tomorrow, but i definitely would have been back to enjoy another meal. From the host, Quinton, to the server, Trish, and the manager, Hilary, i was thoroughly impressed. I enjoyed the stumptown cold brew coffee and the most delicious steak and eggs I've ever had. This was very similar to a steak Benedict, but with interesting flavors in every component of the dish. Thank you for creating such a wonderful experience for me. I will definitely be back when I return to Austin.",5.0 star rating
We had brunch New Year's Day 2016. The food was wonderful. I had the Migas and the other three had the hash though the shrimp and grits were recommended by a friend. Our waiter earned the fifth star. He was attentive without being pushy and smiled sincerely. I wish I could remember his name. He had sleeves of tattoo which I only admired after I was charmed by his performance.,5.0 star rating
"Our visit here was for a wedding reception and the restaurant was rented out for this lovely event.  The service was impeccable, the staff was friendly and accommodating.  The food was pretty good - nothing that was really over the top, but tasty and attractively plated.  For this reception, guests paid for their own liquor (smart on the part of the host) and we were a little surprised to spend $64 for 2 scotch & waters and 1 pinot grigio.  It didn't diminish the lovely experience but it was a little intense considering what we drank. I'd definitely visit Trace again but will be sure there is plenty of room on my credit card.",4.0 star rating
"I haven't dined at TRACE for about a year and forgot how wonderful this place is! The high quality of both service and food are consistent. The menu changes seasonally and they have excellent chefs.I won a gift card via Twitter from TRACE, the first 5 people to tweet them received $50 towards dinner. We checked in at the host stand and were politely greeted and seated. We sat indoors facing the patio. It was a gorgeous spring day so they had the doors open providing fresh air and a beautiful view. Our server Zane was patient (I had lots of questions) and helpful. Jesse ordered his go to jalapeno cucumber lemonade and I opted for a French Sauvignon Blanc. We started off with hamachi crudo and the coconut curry mussels. The delicious hamachi crudo was garnished with a dusting of salt and candied Meyer lemon wedges. Jesse's mussels were in an aromatic sauce of lemongrass and curry and was also great. For our entrees I went with the black drum and Jesse ordered the organic chicken. The drum was perfectly seasoned and lightly seared. I loved the flavors of the fish with the light broth it was served in. Chicken can be boring if not done right, that was not the case here. The hearty portion of tender chicken also pan seared was well seasoned and had an a jus broth that complimented the flavors of the meat. This dish also had artichoke chicken sausage, kale and pine nuts. We asked for wine pairing suggestions with our entree and Zane made some excellent suggestions.Stuffed to the brim we declined dessert but Zane sent out their amazing butterscotch bourbon pudding with bacon brittle what!?! I wanted to kiss their pastry chef!One thing I could see improving is offering complimentary valet for dinner guests. They do offer ""discounted"" valet ($7 instead of $15) but even the W's Away Spa offers free valet.Service is excellent, food amazing and the desserts divine.",5.0 star rating
"I'm glad they're here. Many times when I park at City Hall Plaza I want a quick bite on my way to my destination. Good, filling sandwiches at a reasonable price, and, most important, quick.

"Always tasty... not always the right order.  When you literally write your order down topping by topping, you would think mistakes in your order would be minimal.  You would be surprised.  That being said, they do deliver a quality product!Conveniently located downtown, Which Wich is a great spot for a sandwich when you are a bit short on time... but don't expect super speedy sandwich creation.  Compared to competitors Jimmy John's and Subway, it will always take longer to receive your order at Which Wich, noticeably so.  I am not sure why that is, but it's the sad truth nonetheless.  And ALWAYS, and I do mean ALWAYS, check your order before leaving.  About 40% of the time when I go here, there is a mistake in my order.  I wish this was an exaggeration, but its not.  All of that being said however, the sandwiches are delicious!  The ingredient are fresh, the bread soft, and the options you can create for yourself are diverse.  Additionally the Oreo milkshake is to DIE for.  Really, it is one of the best I have ever had.  So what is my take away?  Definitely worth going, but Which Wich loses some serious points for the wait, and the fact that you ALWAYS need to check your order before leaving.",4.0 star rating

"I think I most enjoy Which Wich because you get to write your order on these cute little bags with a Sharpie. This plays right into my love of office supplies and documentation.It's, like, if they get it wrong, you can be all, ""Uh, that's not what my bag says."" Plus they put the bags on this metal string with those clippy things attached and slide it towards the sandwich preparation people and I like the sound of the order zipping across the line. I had a roast beef sandwich and it was pretty darn good for a chain restaurant. The bread was a little too crispy and as crispy bread is wont to do, it tore my mouth up. Ouch!What blew my mind though, was the chocolate milkshake. Um...thick and chocolaty and love and babies and pink and happiness and angels and awesome. So, try the milkshake. You won't be disappointed.",3.0 star rating
"Hi Which Wich, I fell in love with you in Austin and see that you are opening up several locations in LA soon. PLEASE HURRY UP!!!! I MISS YOU SO MUCH. I love the simplicity and options for this sandwich shop - pick a wich, grab a sharpie and check all the boxes of ingredients that you want. They have 12 categories of protein to choose from - from breakfast all day, seafood, to comfort food. Since I can't eat bread (gluten-free), they have the option of a bowl where it's basically over salad. After my first wich-bowl, I was addicted and came back daily. My fav are the chicken cordon bleu (chicken and ham) and the chicken salad. I see Which Wich as my Chipotle causal fast food replacement. Join the vibe club for a free wich!",5.0 star rating
Love this place.  I discovered it during a fit of major hunger when I was near the end of a busy day and realized I had forgotten to eat!    The order system is great - I can choose as much or as little I want in toppings.  The girl working the counter was helpful in making suggestions too.   They made my sandwich in an acceptable amount of time and it sure was fresh and tasty!  Great job!,5.0 star rating
"This place is awesome!! It has a very creative and fun system of ordering, which is to customize your order on the sandwich bag. Everything is written out with as many options as possible to minimize any potential screw-ups in your sandwich. Which to me, could be quite devastating.I love the huge variety in hot and cold sandwiches, and everything in between. Prices are fair, but the sandwich is on the smaller side. Quality of food is really good for a chain though. They have many fresh veggie options as well as meats. It's also very neat to see them make your order as they see your bag. Also means they can't forget your order and what you want is explicitly on the bag.And I have to note, they bolt the tables down so you can't move them around if you have a large party.",4.0 star rating

"I like how you use a sharpie to check off the items you want included in your sandwich right on the bag it will come in. This can also lead to ingredient overload. You might really like pickles, pineapple and olives, but do they all really need to be on your Turkey sandwich?

"I just had the ""Wicked"" for lunch and it was pretty darn tasty.  This place is right around the corner from my job, and seems to hit the spot.  Yes, the service is a litlle lacking sometimes, but the sandwich sorta makes up for it!Update:Yes, it is right around the corner from City Hall, and sorta cheap for downtown.  I ordered the Cuban today, and I have to say that it was awesome.  Prolly not as good as Tucci's Southside, but it was really tasty.  I only added cole slaw, and I think that was the ticket.  The funny thing is that the service there is hit or miss.  Perhaps it was because I forgot to take off my city badge today, but the service was great!  That been said, I am going to move my rating from a 3 to a 4.  I do indeed love the tea there too.",4.0 star rating
Saw this place on Yelp and our group of 8 went in for sandwiched. It took them over 45 minute to complete the order and with terrible attitude.

Mystery meat alert!!  I ordered the buffalo chicken as a bowl from a cool friendly guy with a beard and glasses.  Buffalo chicken is usually deep fried and battered no?  Not here.  Processed 'chicken' bologna meat product with Tabasco.  There should be a law against referring to meat product as chicken.  The girl who made it forgot three items and seems very not thrilled to be here.  Other yelpers say to check your order.  That's certainly good advice.  Two stars because of the cashier and you can draw on the bag.,2.0 star rating

The broccoli was not all that either, but the black beans were pretty good.  My partner got a honey mustard chicken sandwich and she complained about it the whole time, no honey mustard, it had a little piece of chicken, she was so disappointed, and believe me she is pretty easy to please.  Our waiter was good, but a bit buried, it was hard to get his attention, but when we had it he was very pleasant.  We pay for service, no doubt, but we want an all around great experience when dining out, this was just not the place for us.  So there you go our last experience at Texas Land & Cattle.",2.0 star rating
"Reviewed for this specific location for dinner.  Let me start by stating that I am not a Texan, but I really can't see what all the fuss is over this smoked sirloin.  Yes it is amazingly slow-cooked and melts in your mouth, but I should have ordered the Rib-eye or Porterhouse to get some flavor.  Now I'm forced to conclude that this place is just ordinary, and qualifies as over-hyped.  That's what Texans call ""smoked""?  Austin really is weird.I think I'll try the hotel restaurant tomorrow.",3.0 star rating
By far my favorite steakhouse! It even beats the more expensive steakhouse! I've been to the $$$ or $$$$ and this place could beat it's butt! I get the smoked sirloin cooked medium. It is amazing!

They offered to cook it more but it was already 10 minutes late. It was embarrassing in front of clients. Dessert was fine. Wait staff said we've taken care of your meal.

I went with my kids once and sat at a table and waited more than 45 minutes for a med rare steak, and two kids burgers. The waitress was pretty and nice but terrible at her job. She screwed up our very simple order and brought one of my kids a steak instead of a burger. IDK what really happened between our ordering simple food and her deciding to bring my 8 year old daughter a steak... I can't really blame the kitchen staff because I watched other tables around us get their food even though they arrived after we did. When it came time to pay the bill there was no discount despite how awful the service (we were pretty thirsty the whole time due to no refills on our water) and despite speaking to the manager. I should have driven past the restaurant and went to fiesta food mart and bought steak there and cooked it myself. I would have eaten sooner.",1.0 star rating

"My experience here was far below that of other TL&Cs in Austin and elsewhere. Management refused to honor their own discount certificate; the main course came out just after the salad; the steak, ordered medium-rare, was raw; I ordered a Cajun rib eye and it came out without seasoning. In short, nobody is minding this store. The assistant manager offered to ""make it right"" by re-cooking my steak but once the tempo of the meal is broken (my wife was already done with her steak by the time he came by) it was hard too see what he could do. This place needs to learn something about customer service, and watching the kitchen. If they send you a $5-off certificate, they should honor it. And they shouldn't embarrass or try to humiliate you in front of your guests. They should time the service so you can enjoy your courses, especially when many tables were empty and there were no people waiting to be seated, so there was no need to rush the meal. If I just wanted food I would have ordered take-out. What I wanted was an enjoyable experience. That they did not provide.",2.0 star rating

I went for the the Smoked Salmon Caesar Salad. The salmon had a really nice flavor, but the salad itself was just okay.

"It's places like this that are making ME look like the bad guy. I'm not a Gordon Ramsay type of critic. But, I know my food and I just had to rush home to write this review and post it. I still have 3 other unfinished reviews. I decided this one takes precedence. I ordered what I thought was Country Fried Chicken and it turned out to be the exact opposite of a Chicken Fried Steak. So a chicken breast with gravy on it. My fault for not knowing that since it was under the Chicken Fried Steak, I, should have known better.But, I do know this!!! The chicken was Old! It was bad! I was trying to figure out if it was some sort of frozen Banquet Chicken. Our waiter told us it was fresh and breaded onsite. I guess I didn't ask when was it breaded? It tasted like it was breaded last week and kept in the freezer until my dumb-ass ordered it. Yeah, I'm dumb and I know better than to ask for anything but steak at a Steak House. My Wife had the sirloin and it was o.k. The people in the booth next to us complained to the waiter about their food after he(their waiter,not ours) walked away with a disgusted look. He went to get the manager who came over to their table and asked the same questions about the quality of the food the waiter just got done asking. After whatever she(the Manager) went to go do. She came back out and resumed her lunch across from us. Nice! joins us! No break rooms here? I know it's hard to run a business when there's more employees than customers. But, Seriously!?! So in conclusion and to this point wondering where my waiter went? I had to go to the front and find a different waiter to ring me up. That's a 10% tip. The chicken, get a new supplier and throw out the bad stuff. Someone might get sick and remember it's a business your running, maybe it doesn't belong to you? and maybe you would rather be home watching Judge Judy? But, you still need to treat it like a business and someday your customer might return. Psych! Dream on.  Oh, before I forget. My mom used to make us these Mexican tortas(sandwiches) with Bolillos or sometimes referred to as birotes. It's a bread traditionally made in Mexico. How does it end up in this steak house or any steak house? Maybe Texas Roadhouse will sell you some of their bread?",1.0 star rating
"Went here when I visited my uncle and aunt in Austin. Going in, I had this stereotype about Texas food all being cow and fried things dipped in ranch or ketchup.

You won't leave on an empty stomach... portions are huge. Overall, no wow-factor for me, but not horrible. Went home and downed a glass of Metamucil.",3.0 star rating
"Food not that great, service so-so, on one visit with co workers at lunch,   one of my co workers asked for a tea and the waitress asked if he would like a peach or rasberry tea  and did not tell him that it was a 16 oz. bottled tea for four dollars- he wasn't too pleased and took it out of her tip. Do yourself a favor and go to Saltgrass or Roadhouse instead.",2.0 star rating
Sooooooo slow. That's what remember most about our meal Friday night.The food took forever to come out even though the restaurant wasn't full and they only had one steak to prepare for our table of two since I'm vegetarian. Our waitress was slow and forgot everything. When the steak came out she asked us herself if we wanted A1 and we said we did. It never came. Ever.,2.0 star rating

"I'm sure you will have a fine time if you go at a random time but if you aren't taking advantage of the superb happy hour at BarChi you are missing out on one of the best in Austin. Check out the times when you can get Happy Hour:Mon - Wed 3pm-7pmThurs 3pm-7pm and 10pm-12amFri - Sat 3pm-7pm and 10pm-1:00amSun - All DayYou almost have to find a time when you can't get Happy Hour.

Tasty food, delicious drinks and a great schedule to indulge in all the Happy Hour specials!",4.0 star rating
"For it being a sushi restaurant, I was very, very, very... I will keep stressing the word very underwhelmed with their sushi. The rolls that my friend ordered might have been the wrong choice, but still.. come on. All I can mostly remember was how much panko crumbs they dumped on the sushi rolls I guess to disguise how absolutely terrible it was. I would have definitely just given it 1 star, BUT what saved it from me EVER even thinking about wanting to come back was their Seafood Hot pot.Oh. My. Gosh. I wanted to bathe in it. I wanted it to be endless. It's a red Thai curry, with scallops, shrimp, mussels, green onions and vegetables. I shared it with someone, but I wish I would have gotten my own. My mouth is watering just thinking about it again...",2.0 star rating
"I absolutely love this place. It's my prime happy hour spot. Everyone who I've brought here has loved it too. They have reverse happy hour too which is always such a blast. I like going as a ""pregame"" since they have all the good jams and the great prices. It's hard to say no to $2 sake bombs and $5 lychee martinis. I also highly recommend the fried calamari. I get the Nemo roll which is pretty big. Keep in mind the cheaper rolls are smaller along with the spring rolls and the yakitori. You'll get it and wonder if they accidentally put it on your table instead of the table for ants. Nonetheless, one of my favorite places hands down.",5.0 star rating

"Was excited to try Bar Chi with friends for reverse happy hour but left totally disappointed. I ordered yellowtail from the happy hour menu which I pointed to. I was brought what I thought was yellow tail just without the rice. I ate it because I didn't want to complain. Then about 20 mins later a server(food runner) brought out what looked like it was the correct order. I had already eaten the other food and told him that it wasn't mine. Then received my check that was 50$. The fish I ordered was 1.80 per piece and I ordered 3 pieces, so naturally I had the waiter come over who brought the manger. The manager refused to change the price claiming that's what I ordered and said the waiter would have to take it out of his check, which I didn't want! What kind of management does that! The waiter changed my check and I only paid for the fish I had originally ordered, so I thought. I just checked my bank account and I was charged not only for the price I agreed to pay but a separate charge that covered the fish they incorrectly brought out. Terrible experience and I will be calling them and my bank.",1.0 star rating

The restroom is a single restroom though, so expect to have to wait in line for a while. Great wine and bubbly selection as well.  Some bubbly they will even deliver in the mini bottle which makes you feel even fancier!",4.0 star rating
Visited here this past weekend with my wife and some friends. The food and service was great and the only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star rating is because of how we greeted and escorted to a table. The place was semi busy and when we arrived no one welcomed us or told us anything really. We stood there while a couple hostesses or management asked us how many people were in our party. Eventually they figured it out and sat us. With that out of the way the remainder of our evening there was delightful and entertaining. The menu and food is delicious and our waitress did a great job. This joint gets packed. So the noise level can make it a challenge to talk to others. From what I understand they have a pretty amazing happy hour also. We are looking forward to returning to try it out.,4.0 star rating
"They have Sunday happy hour all day til 10 PM. Most things were about $1-2 off the regular price, but some of the rolls had a bigger discount. I ordered the vegetable tempura, fried calamari, and Chi rolls. Partner got fried spring rolls vegetarian, edamame, and avocado and cucumber roll. The tempura vegetables were standard. I was disappointed in the fried calamari because the waitress misheard and brought me a California roll. When I did get the calamari, it was more American-style than Asian-style with thick breading and served with marinara sauce. The Chi roll had spicy white fish topped with pepper tuna, avocado and spicy ponzu sauce. It was alright. It also took a long time to get a drink after half-way through the meal. Food overall was ok. Service was ok. It was pretty busy on a Sunday night, I guess with all the happy hour specials. Accepts credit cards. Good place for happy hour.",3.0 star rating
"Super chill spot in downtown to get some sushi during HH before you head downtown. The staff is really nice, and the ambiance is nice as well. The sushi was ok, but nothing really to complain about.

"We just finished what was almost a terrible first experience at TRACE. We came to dine this prior to the Lyle Lovett concert.  As sometimes happens, the kitchen got very backed up and after waiting 40 minutes our entrées arrived five minutes before the concert was to begin. Needless to say, we were not happy.The server, Jenna, to her credit, grabbed the manager Natalie right away without us even asking.  Natalie immediately offered several options to rectify the situation, and we chose to have our meals stored and return to pick them up after the concert. Upon returning, Natalie immediately recognized us, ushered us in through the locked front door, and personally served us at the bar.Needless to say, Natalie completely turned our experience around.  She has outstanding service instincts. Despite what I'm sure was already a long evening for her, she cared enough to ensure that we had a positive impression of Trace. She succeeded, and I assure you we will be back. All establishments run into issues but it's how they respond that matters.",5.0 star rating
"What an amazing restaurant!!! ROBERT took phenomenal care of us as our waiter. He made great recommendations for food - we went with the butternut squash agnolotti and quail (yum). And, as soon as I mentioned it was my birthday weekend, he pulled out ALL the stops. A glass of Veuve, two glasses of a special rosé for the table, and chocolate cake wishing ""Happy Birthday John"" in cursive chocolate sauce. To top everything off, he even arranged for my friend and I to have two cocktails of our choice in the Living Room, and personally escorted us there. The ambience of Trace is amazing, the food is top-notch. Just based on this experience alone, I will 100% be staying at the W next time I'm in Austin. Thank you for an unforgettable evening!!",5.0 star rating
"Was staying at the W for the week, stopped in for happy hour drinks and snacks. Pulled pork sliders, pork tostadas, and a horseradish dip (Bread and chips provided).

Will definitely make a return trip in the near future ...",5.0 star rating
"Trace is committed to sustainable agriculture and serving as an Austin ambassador with superb food and service. Even better (for me) was that they gave me a generous gift card to come try out the dinner menu before it switches over to Spring offerings after SXSW. What's not to love? Starting our dinner at 5:30p on windy February Friday was a great move. We had reservations for 6:15 (still squarely in the ""seniors and diaper-wearers"" dining hours), but the hostess was kind enough to seat us early when our walk to the W from the Convention Center did not take as long as we'd anticipated. At this hour, the beautiful, modern dining room was left only to us, blissfully quiet. We had the undivided attention of our handsome waiter... lovely!My adventurous dining partner chose the country fried sweetbreads (that's calf thymus to you and me) to start, giving the kitchen notice that we were two ladies up for anything. The order arrived in a hot cast iron dish garnished with some fresh green sprigs, 6 two-bite pieces with succulent, tender flesh inside, light and crispy coating on the outside. Perfect preparation.Next we moved on to our entrees, I choosing the macadamia-encrusted, locally grown Niman Ranch filet special and she the striped bass.  Because we're sweet like that, we split each plate and had the pleasure of both dishes.  Oh that rare beef!  Oh that delicate fish! Really, nothing more to say but, ""Mmmmmmmmm.""By the time we were finished with our plates, the dining room was full to capacity and had taken on a whole different vibe. Lots of out-of-town visitors (to be expected in a busy hotel restaurant) were there, but so were plenty of stylish locals who know about Trace's great service and excellent kitchen. At our 2-top against the upholstered banquet, we had neighbors on one side who were high tech guys from Google, visiting from California and looking for advice about where to grab an interesting cocktail later. (We sent them to Garage.) On the other side, we met a friendly couple who split time between Austin, Houston, and Dallas. They were looking for great desserts beyond Trace (for them, the rec was Cupcaking Desire). While we began with an intimate setting, it was fun to wind up in a sort of communal dining setup where we could chat with new friends who love food & drink as much as we do.As we chatted with our neighbors, we also savored the chocolat au lait dessert, a gorgeous plate with Valrhona Caramélia mousse (wrapped in caramel), crumbly milk chocolate almond cake, Opalys white chocolate ganache, velvety vanilla Oplalys crème and tart raspberry gel. This smooth and mild dessert was not as chocolate-y as I'd usually prefer, but for those who don't want to be punched in the face with dark chocolate flavor, this would be just about perfect. On the plus side, I loved that the dark coffee was served with rustic chunks of turbinado sugar on the side.I cannot wait to return to Trace, and this time, I'm bringing my ""special friend"" for a romantic parents' night out. It will be delightful to discover what turns up on the new Spring menu.",5.0 star rating
Have you ever painted with your dessert before? It's the best. There are swirls of raspberry red and blueberry blue.

I could go on.But the flourless chocolate torte is art.,4.0 star rating
"I, too, took my awesome gift card for dinner and couldn't wait for the roomie to try the food. For a drink I ordered the ginger lemonade and I wished I could have ordered a pitcher of that. Wow that is one tasty drink!Roomie ordered the cheese and potato soup. It is a rich creamy soup covered with a layer of cheese (think French Onion). Delicious. We also split a Charcuterie and Salumi. The meats were oh so good and the house mustard was one of the best I have had. The manager also stopped by with the Easy Tiger bread. I liked the hummus butter but wasn't crazy about the other two on the plate. Next up, the rib eye which we split. Juicy and tender, we tried cutting it with a fork and it was easy as pie. Wonderful. The mushroom stuffed potato was one of my favorite things of the evening. The only issues I had with the food were the sides. The country baked beans were so salty they were inedible. The fries were good, but the onion rings just didn't do it for me, and I sure didn't like the sauce that came with it. Before we left Chef Angel gave us a little gift to take home, the carrot cake praline. Man, this woman knows her desserts that is for sure. Carrot cake with praline mouse. Decadent. So besides the not so great sides, the other thing that is keeping this from being 5 stars was our waiter. He was super nice, don't get me wrong, but he was just a bit......awkward. It's really hard to explain, but it just felt he was too far away and was really unsure of himself. He may be new so hopefully he will build his confidence up and be as good as the other waiter we heard at another table. If there were specials that night we never heard them. All in all, a great dining experience and I can't wait to go back when they get those BLT shooters on the menu!",4.0 star rating
"I totally messed up and ate every bit of food we were served before I ever took a picture, but this place is such a treat! The combinations of dishes are so creative while still being spot on, flavor wise. We did a bunch of apps and cheese and bread and desserts this go around and everything was delicious. The collard greens with sweet potatoes were perfect paired with the cornmeal onion rings. I felt like I was in my grandmother's kitchen for a split second (she doesn't have crushed velvet couches!)Service was amazing. Food was delicious. I'm not usually a fancy dining kind of person, but I would come back here in a heart beat. Everything we ate was amazing. Try the maple dessert....we almost licked the plate clean!",5.0 star rating

"Excited to update with a better experience than last time. Service was great, my jalapeno lemonade was intensely refreshing and my steak frites perfectly prepared.Started with a charcuterie and it was huge - lots of nice meats to sample with assorted condiments. Also shared some crab cakes - just crabby enough and great texture. Got the aforementioned steak frites and those were fabulous. The steak came with a blue-cheese butter that had JUST the right amount of blue cheese flavor. Sometimes that combo can be a little overwhelming, but this one was just right.Had a chocolate-y concoction for dessert - it was rich and just a bite or two hit the spot. A fan of TRACE. Could for sure make it a regular stop when in Austin.",4.0 star rating
"4 stars is pushing it, but they don't offer 3.5 stars. For a restuarant of this calliber, I expect the staff to be in the know, and on top of their game.Here we go - lets start with the good ... ambience, decor, reservations - 5 starfood - 5 starwaiters energy - 5 starand the bad. We ordered Don Julio shots - they came out watered down and had ice in them.  NEVER put ice in a tequila shot, we even asked if the tequila had been chilled in a fridge.  The waiter said yes.When we complained he stated they were chilled via shaker and the bartender had one hell of an arm on her, and that explained the ice.  Lame excuse, but lets move on.   We got a new round!We explained dietary needs to the waiter - he suggested the market sampler because we could all have a bite.  The seller - bacon wrapped figs for the paleo peeps.  The platter arrived and there were no figs, we asked for them and he said they would be right out. we waited, and waited, then he came out to say they ran out.NEXT - we ordered the scallops - we were told they had two left, we ordered, he came back - they were out. Finally - we were able to order and all dishes came out complete.They were tasty, and full of flavor.  The brussel sprouts are to die for.Other than a few hiccups dinner was great.  I hope next time the waiter staff is more informed and the dinner is a little smoother.",4.0 star rating
"We went for the launch of their happy hour.  Since I believe this was their first happy hour, from 5-7p they were circling around with free samples of a few happy hour menu items and a choice of two drinks.In order of favorites...Pork belly slider - this was actually very good.  I couldn't get a picture that would focus in the dim lighting but it was a small bite about the size of my palm.  I was wary at first because it was a lot of bread ratio to the pork belly inside.  When I took my first bite, it was a mix of perfect flavors and textures.  To better explain, the bread although fluffy, big, and pretty much engulfing the pork belly to where it can barely be seen, ended up being very soft and light.  The pork belly was delicious and tender enough to bite through, and the sriracha aoili sauce was a perfect touch.  I'm not sure if there was cilantro but I definitely tasted a hint of cilantro (just enough to add a perfect touch).Butterscotch bourbon pudding - I'm going to give the bacon brittle an A+, caramel pound cake croutons an A, and the bourbon pudding itself an A-.  Overall a good dish.  I liked the different textures of everything - the soft pudding, the crunchy brittle and the crunchy croutons work well together.  I could definitely taste the bacon in the brittle.  The croutons were not as expected as they were the size of my fingernail and not the kind of crunch as if you were to bite into a regular crouton.  It was almost a dense caramelized yummy candy bite.  The pudding was ok but hindsight now that I know what type of pudding it is (bourbon) maybe now it seems fitting - not too strong of a flavor as I did not know it was bourbon until I read the menu.  Beware though - this is a sweets overload even in the small sample size I got. Definitely something I would share.? - I'm mot too sure what this next one was.  It looked like a mini bratwurst in bread.  Maybe it was the mini goat sandwhich?  I thought I took a picture but I guess not.  The sausage on top was good flavor.  The bread was a little dense and too much for the size of the sausage.  The was only a little sauce and nothing else to the dish.  Minus too much bread, overall ok.Smoked brisket taco - you could definitely taste the smoked brisket.  I wasn't really feeling the taco style.  I didn't like the corn tortilla and the brisket together.   The corn tortilla almost over powered the flavor for me.  But, I'm also not a huge corn tortilla fan.... Jalapeno and cucumber lemonade - my fiance actually did not like this. I thought it was good enough to drink.   I liked the touch of spicy and the flavors were suttle.  It didn't really taste like lemonade and it wasn't really a sweet drink (which is good for me because I don't like ""girly drinks"").It was very busy and not too much seating inside so it was hard to drink and eat while standing in a cramped space.  Maybe on a warmer day when we can sit on the patio and relax and enjoy....",4.0 star rating

"Having read some recent negative reviews, and having noted that places at this price point don't issue Groupons if they can afford not to, the missus and I were a little hesitant about Trace. I'd read about the tiny portions and slow service, but didn't encounter either. PLUSES: Maybe we were helped by a sparse noon lunch crowd, but we thought both the food and service at Trace were pretty awesome. Ordered most of the starters: the crispy Texas artichokes (w/ capers, lemon aioli), goat cheese and gorgonzola mushrooms (baked goat cheese & mushroom gratin, toasted baguette), crab and jalapeno fritters (w/ creole remoulade), and hand-cut herb fries (w/ Watson's chipotle ketchup). Then split a blackened Gulf drum sandwich. Everything was well-presented, creatively prepared, and delicious. Our seat at the inside/outside border near the patio was lovely--cool, shaded, and free of the brisk wind on a May afternoon. Service was friendly, informed, and attentive.MINUSES: Fries were billed at $8 despite being listed on the menu at $5, the ultra-modern decor is trying waaaaaaayyy too hard, finding the bathrooms requires a map, and (even given the prime location) $11 for a house bloody mary is insane. Some of these are minor gripes, to be sure, but at this admission level, the expectations are going to be pretty high. Our experience, then, was very good but not quite great.",4.0 star rating
"I went here on a date on Valentine's Day for their fixed-price dinner and was pretty disappointed.The food was pretty good, but certainly not worth the price. The avocado & lobster salad and the mango & coconut pudding dessert were great. The lamb loin and the beef filet and they oysters were pretty good, but the salads and the raspberry & white chocolate dessert were 'meh'. The wine selection is extensive and impressive.The main reason this is a 2-star review is that the service was appalling. Considering that when we arrived the restaurant was 75% empty, our waitress took an incredibly long time to bring us menus, take our order, and bring out each course. She also mocked my date's foreign accent and for 3 of the 4 courses, the wrong dish was placed in front of each of us (which is even worse than just randomly guessing who had which dish).Overall it was pretty nice ambiance and the food was good, but not great, and the service was subpar.

"Met up with a few friends here on a Saturday morning. They were full of reservations after 10AM, so we dined on the early side of the brunch rush.I had picked the place because they advertised a DJ playing soul and funk during brunch, which sounded fun and quintessential Austin. However, once she started, I realized we were seated too far away to really hear her. Our breakfasts were tasty but pricey, especially since I just went for the continental (eggs, bacon, etc) and still ended up paying more than $20 with coffee.

"We had the opportunity to dine here on Tuesday night.  We have gone there several times, but not since the new addition was added.  The restaurant was moderately busy, but the atmosphere was great.  For those that have not had the chance to go yet, this restaurant captures what made Austin great.  Small town feel wrapped within a great down town area.  If you sit inside, it's cool and relaxed.  If you opt for the patio area - awesome people watching.  On this occasion we sat in the new area of the restaurant.  The new area can be closed off from the rest of the restaurant for a private dining experience or would be a great area for happy hour.  We really enjoyed eating in there.  The night we were there, the area had couches, lounge type chairs and a pretty cool sound track playing.  The service and food was incredible as always.  I had the lasagne and my bride the carpaccio with a mussel appetizer.  Pictures included as is a quick pic of the area.  You really need to see it in person to do it justice.  In addition, my bride is gluten sensitive and their menu is loaded with things to try - you don't feel like your limited to a few items.",5.0 star rating

"Disappointing is an understatement! Taverna's location is great, but that's about it. The service was off-putting, from the reception. Despite the fact that we live a couple of blocks away and (used to be) in and out of Taverna all the time, we were told (on a cold Wednesday evening in December) that every table in the essentially empty dining room was reserved, and we must sit out on the crowded, plastic-draped patio. I doubted the veracity, but - ok, we accepted our ""penance"" for not calling ahead, and took our seats on 2nd Street...where we sat with no water, bread or attention, until we flagged down a waitperson. She promised to be ""right back"". She was not. After another five minutes or so, which she spent casually chatting up the next table, our waitperson unapologetically ""stopped by"". My wife explained that we were in a hurry, to which she flatly replied, ""we are all in a hurry"".  That interchange ended our evening at Taverna. We then enjoyed a fantastic dinner at a competing Italian neighborhood gem, whose brilliant cuisine, service and ambiance seemed even brighter juxtaposed to our Taverna experience. I will say, this was one data point, and doesn't qualify as a trend line. We will give Taverna another try, but it won't be soon. Addio per ora, Taverna, addio.",1.0 star rating

We got there just before the crowd arrived and we were able to be seated outside (a covered patio with what looks like portable swamp coolers to keep the air cool). The hostess was very sweet and friendly. Our waiter was great but wasn't sure what the sandwich board read and knew nothing of ""Bacon Bellini Mimosa"" so I settled for a mimosa (actually 4 of them, but who's counting?) and the asparagus and shrimp omelette with hollandaise. It was amazing! The service really was good and as it got busier we were able to really people watch and laugh more than we had in years. People are just plain funny and I'm sure they all got a laugh out of us. Pricing was reasonable for the amount of food and drink. I recommend arriving early or expecting a long wait. The patio can get pretty warm even with the swamp coolers. Enjoy y'all!",5.0 star rating
"This place has since expanded and is back to proper business.  I like the downtown location and al fresco dining options, they seem to be oping more of the patio as well... hopefully they keep up the improvements.  Although, something must be done about the canned crab in the crab benedict :(",3.0 star rating
"We shared the grilled squid as an appetizer, the squid itself was nicely executed, but the sides (potatoes and a kind of sauce) were way too salty. We then had two classic pizzas, they were fine, not authentic as what you might get in Italy, but edible. We had plenty of pizza left for the next day, they are rather large.",3.0 star rating
"Two things struck me on first visit to Taverna on 2nd. The first was how well the wait staff worked together. It felt like they were a family. But the other thing I want to make sure you know about Taverna, most importantly,Focaccia. Bite into a slice, crunchy, just out of the oven. Yup.",4.0 star rating
"We went there on Saturday to cool off from the scorching TX weather, as I had a decent experience once before with their risotto.  However I should have remembered that last time we went, we already sent back the sea bass which was pretty terrible. Didn't exactly know what we wanted, so decided to ask about the specials on the chalk board. Were told that all specials had expired, except the soup or salad. Decided to start with the $14 salad. Expected a decent size salad for that price. What we got was salad with 2 slices of beefsteak tomatoes covered with a few meager leaves of lettuce in a tasty champagne vinaigrette, with a side of a quarter of avocado and perhaps 2 spoons worth of what seemed to be canned crab meat. I was shocked. It's not that the salad was bad, but the amount was ridiculously small and there was virtually no crab on it and it tasted like it came from a can.The iced tea was so strong that it was bitter (and I like strong tea!) and service was very unimpressive. Salad didn't even come with bread basket to snack on (you know, with olive oil like in so many Italian places). I was not a happy customer and I left.",1.0 star rating

Our server tonight was super attentive, which I love.I always get the risotto when I'm here and have yet to be disappointed. The specials are always good and everything is cooked to perfection. To be honest, the sangria and tiramisu are my favorite items here. Please try either one (or both) if you decide to stop by!",5.0 star rating
"I love this place, everything I've ordered here has been scrumptious. I would give it 5 stars except that I haven't had a full entree here yet. I absolutely love the buffalo mozzarella caprese, it's soft, fresh and ohh so good. I also really enjoyed the house salad it was a large portion for only $5. The margherita pizza is delicious! Goes great with a glass of wine. It's large enough to feed 2 people. I've been there for brunch and happy hour. During brunch the mimosas and bellinis are only $1. Definitely worth it to check this place out for the brunch drink specials alone. I've had the chorizo sausage and manchego cheese omelet but I don't remember it being particularly delicious, it was ok but sounded better than it tasted. For happy hour the items are half off (or close to half off):Arancini di roso (rice balls with bolognese) - were ok, a little dry and needed more sauceCariciofo al forno (Roasted artichocke) - yummy! I especially loved the aiolifocaccia - this was pretty good, it rivaled the pizzaI'd love to go back and try a dinner entree but I'd definitely recommend checking out the happy hour and brunch!",4.0 star rating
"Taverna is everything a good restaurant should be. The clam appetizer was the first excellent dish; followed by the hearty but not heavy gnocchi with short rib ragout and salmon, cooked to the perfect crisp with asparagus and spinach.  Everything was fresh, flavorful, impeccably prepared with layers of flavor.  Each bite was truly excellent.  Topped off with friendly service, tasty cocktails and a wine special.   I'm fortunate to live upstairs and will definitely be back.  Try it out!",5.0 star rating

"Great brunch spot with $1.84 mimosas/bellinis. Brunch menu consists of omelettes, eggs benedict, chicken and waffles, french toast, etc... Food is decent and prices are around $11-15 a plate. My eggs benedict were good, but I'm not totally raving about them. If you want a treat, definitely order the beignets to share! There's about 6-8 pieces and it comes with a delicious vanilla cream sauce that is to die for!Overall, pretty good brunch spot, but let's just say I wouldn't bring anyone here if I was trying to ""woo"" them or show them a great Austin eatery.",3.0 star rating
"Great dinner. Ordered a bottle of Blu Prosecco, a lovely accompaniment to the meal, light and refreshing in this 100 degree weather. The antipasto Emilio was huge, with plenty of salami, cotto, prosciutto, cheese, olives, and marinated vegetables. Don't fill up on it, though. The fiocchetti were little pasta fortune cookies filled with Gorgonzola, slathered in pears and parmesan cream sauce. OMG. This stuff is a mouth orgasm. But very rich, a few bites are enough, so plan to share. The chicken picatta was tasty, but overcooked and a tad dry. The flavor was spot on, however, and the julienned veggies/potatoes were more than serviceable. The margherita pizza crust was so light and crisp, and the tomato sauce sweet and light. A very nice pizza, and reminiscent of the pizzas I've enjoyed in Italy. Berry sorbet was a light, refreshing end to the meal. House made and delicate, it was served with berries soaked in Grand Marnier. Mmmmmm. Good service and very attentive. Very attractive facility. Clean restrooms. Caring management who checked on tables. I'd definitely recommend Taverna. The bottom line is that they do a lot of stuff right, for reasonable prices (for downtown), in a really nice restaurant.",5.0 star rating
"My love of these restaurants started with Sangrias in Dallas. Since then I've also been to the Taverna there, in Ft Worth, and obviously here. The funny thing is each one is actually a little different. The bellinis are a good example of that. Ive had them served both room temperature and icee cold like this morning. And while the brunch menus are the same, the chefs at each location seem to put their own unique twists  on the items. The price is really the best part. Getting morning buzz before noon for $1 and change each drink? Yes please!The food has always been delicious. I've enjoyed the Belgian waffle, vanilla French toast, chorizo breakfast tacos, omlettes, and finally today tried one of their daily specials. It was a quiche with smoked ham, asparagus, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and fontina cheese served with a side Greek salad. They bake it with enough parmesan on top to give it a crunch and it was highly addicting. We got there a little before brunch cocktails started so we had beignets while we waited. If you don't order these when you come here you are missing out. The glaze had just the slightest hint of lemon that made each one pop with flavor. It's no secret my sweet tooth can be seen from space so this made me extremely happy. While drink prices are fantastic, the food prices are pretty steep. My quiche, while wonderful, was $15. I would understand if there was lobster in it, but for ham and eggs that's high. My husband had the daily hash with brisket and his plate was $18. Usually their non specials are cheaper though, the 'Eggs Any Style' being my normal go to. Still, a great way to start our weekend though after strolling the farmers market.",4.0 star rating
"This was a very disappointing brunch experience for us. And it takes a lot to disappoint me when brunch is involved.First off, the portions are TINY. I joked with my friend that they call it Trace because you only get a trace amount of food on your plate. Seriously, I'm really wondering if my omelet was made with 1 egg. It was that small. Also, I got the ""white omelet,"" thinking it was called that because of the white cheddar listed in the ingredient list on the menu. It turned out to be an egg white omelet. Disgusting. I am a person who appreciates a yolk, thank you. It only came with a small cup of mixed berries. I'm shocked that anyone would be full with this. I ordered an additional side of potatoes (really good) and a side of toast. They took forever to bring the toast. I wanted to eat it with my omelet, so my omelet was cold by the time I got my toast. Second, the service sucked. Like I said, they were late bringing out our toast. Our water glasses sat empty way too long. I know they were busy, but it seemed very disorganized.Let me think of something nice to say. They do your first bloody mary or mimosa for free...and after that, they're only like 3 bucks.",2.0 star rating
"[work cliche]Full disclosure: [/work cliche] yep, we ate here courtesy of the Yelp Elite gift card from the ""Opposites Attract"" event. I didn't mention that 'til the very end because I'd forgotten to make a reservation beforehand as the card said, and they were cool about honoring it anyway. So, I assume there was no pretense about bein' extra-fancy for the Yelpers here.Trace has some tasty, tasty vittles. Oh my. Yes. Portions are on the smaller side, but carefully crafted. For a place housed in a hotel, I really love that they're using quite a few local ingredients, too. It's definitely not a cookie-cutter in-hotel eatery. Prices aren't astonishing for what Trace is, although I wish they'd completely comp parking since they're in the W. The decor is classic W: the older folks will need a flashlight to read the menu, you're all convinced it'll need a remodel in ten years, but hey, neato starburst chandeliers. We started off with the cheese plate. With the selection of cheeses was a fruit jam that just worked with every combo of cheese and bread you could think up. There was a blue, a brie and a gouda that night, and all three were delicious. It was just enough pre-dinner snackage for two people, though, so heads up if you've got a bigger party. I had the lamb, but with white cheddar grits subbed for the usual squash. The lamb was great, coming out in little round cuts that were tender and pink in the middle. The cheese grits were pretty tasty, too, although my inner super classy redneck sort of wanted some Tabasco in there because that's just what you do with grits...and eggs (and let's face it, ""stuff to put hot sauce on"" is half my usual breakfast plate). If there had been hot peppers in the grits, I think I would've been in love. The fries were pretty good, too, and I am by no means a potato fan. These were light and crisp, and the waitress didn't even look at me funny for asking for some mayonnaise to go with them. Boom. Mayo. On my plate. Quickly. My friend got the pierogies. They were good enough that I didn't get to try any, and the goat confit on top was apparently delicious. I heard so much about that goat, and didn't get any. Haha.Hilariously, cards from an Austin search marketing group menu were used under certain items on our plates. I'm not sure if that was the group having a meeting in the corner, but haha. Oh, search marketing. You go 'n' keep gamin' Google, you go-getters, you. (Disclosure #2: I left corporate marketing to go play with cars.) I think the only menu that would've made me chuckle harder would have been one for a vehicle press launch. So, yes, press junket attendees: if you're housed up at the W to review the latest Car You Hope [Local] Hasn't Pooped In Yet and Trace is providing room service, you won't be disappointed.The food and the service was great: just attentive enough not to be a bother. Bonus: when it came time to settle up the bill, the manager came back by and realized that we hadn't used the full amount on the gift card and given that it was a one-time-use deal, they asked if we wanted something to go. That was particularly impressive: we were getting free food, the waitress didn't even know if we were going to tip on our free food yet (we did, because we're not horrible human beings, but still), and they still wanted us to get the maximum bang for our lack-of-bucks. That's going the extra mile on service when they really didn't have to. Cool. Would definitely eat here again, gift card or not.",4.0 star rating

"I came here about a year ago and the food & experience is still stuck in my head. It was one of my first ""fine dining"" experiences and I  absolutely loved this place! Beautiful decor, good wine, and GREAT food! We went around lunch time so we ordered the salmon burger, veggie burger, and I believe it was some type of pasta with rabbit(?). I'm not sure if they still have these items on the menu, but either way I would definitely recommend trying this place out. I can wait to go back and update my review. :)",5.0 star rating
"My experience at Trace as fantastic! The waitstaff were incredibly friendly and made excellent recommendations. After our meal, I would recommend trying the scallops as a starter (perhaps the best part of the meal). Trace is a great date spot, it offers a really beautiful setting with ideal lighting (I mean, really. We all look better under soft light). Plus, there are lots of shiny things to look at, which is a huge part of the experience. The great thing about Trace is that it has its' own bar, or you could wander over to the bar inside the W afterward for a drink.It was recommended that we try the lamb, which was cooked beautifully. I also went for some of the onion (rings) - which weren't by any means greasy (thumbs up!), but still flavorful. I understand that the menu changes seasonally, and all of the offerings they had on the specials menu looked great!Highly recommended if you are in the downtown area looking for a nicer spot to take your honey, or even for a small group of friends.",5.0 star rating
"I can here on a Friday night around 9pm. The place was about 75% full. I asked to sit outside. Pros: -They have a great patio! Cool lights, great lounge area outside and plenty of tables to dine at.- I had the cheese platter for appetizer and the cheese was really great! One of the best I have had. - I had one of the cocktails from the menu (can't remember which one) but it was great, didn't skimp on alcohol. I had two! - I ordered the burger, the burger was cooked to order and the fries that came with it were surprisingly great! Cons:- the food took FOREVERRRRR. And to remind you, the place was not at full capacity.- i ordered my whole meal at the same time. I waited 20 minutes for my appetizer to come. And then another 20 minutes for my main course to come.- a food runner brought my food. And 20 minutes later my waitress had not come by to ask how it was. I had to flag down the hostess because I needed a sauce. - the HOSTESS brought the sauce and of course right after, the waitress came over and asked how everything was.- I saw the manager go to MANY tables but never came to me (I was alone). He probably would have been made aware of this had he bothered to stop by. - I had also ordered an add on Pork Belly to my burger. The pork belly just tasted like a strip of bacon. I've had MUCH better pork belly... If that was even pork belly.I would be back to this place but only for a cocktail on the patio. I would never wait that long for food again. I was there over an hour and a half with not the most stellar experience.",3.0 star rating
"Today was probably the 10th or so time I've been to Trace. It's definitely one of my favorite brunch spots in town and a great place to bring out of town guests. I've also been for lunch and dinner a couple of times and have really never had a bad experience. For brunch today we ordered the migas and eggs benedict. Wasn't as in love with the migas as I had hoped, but the eggs benedict was great. I tend to get ""food envy"" and today was one of those days.... definitely wish I had gone with the eggs benny! Not sure what it was about the migas, but even the presentation of the food didn't seem up to par. Have ordered it before and really enjoyed it in the past, but not so much today. I also love the Farmer's Breakfast, which I've ordered in the past as well. Pretty hearty, and will probably go that route again next time. First round of mimosas is always complimentary with the brunch menu - ummm,  yes please! You can never go wrong with a little bubbly in the morning! (Trace also makes a pretty mean cappuccino, for all you coffee drinkers.) Micah was our server today, and we absolutely loved him. Very personable and a vivacious personality.... great guy to get us in the mood for a full afternoon of shopping later. Only complaint I had with the joint today was that the band (which regularly plays outside on Sundays) was inside right when you walked in. It was super loud and I could hardly talk to the person I was with. Felt like we were shouting and trying to compete with the band that was playing. They sounded great, but I think the restaurant should reconsider having them play if it's a cold day and they aren't able to perform outside on the patio.I will say that everything on their menu is priced quite reasonably. Anytime I recommend to my friends that we go to The W for brunch, that quickly try to turn it down thinking it will be uber expensive. But honestly, their brunch and regular menu are no more expensive than any other trendy restaurant in town. So don't let ""dining at The W"" scare you. Try it, and I promise you'll be glad you did.One thing I would like to note about a past experience, is that the TRACE pastry chef is fabulous! I had a personalized cake made for a friend's birthday. I sent in pictures of what I wanted ahead of time, and was a little nervous about how it would turn out... but it was FABULOUS! Don't think I could have asked for a better design. Would definitely recommend talking with them about this if you intend to plan a party here anytime.",4.0 star rating

"I came here recently for the first time for my birthday. I had high hopes for it since it had great reviews. Decor: Fabulous. Loved everything about the space. Everything from the seating to the lighting was perfect. Service: Great service. However, they don't bring you the dessert menu until the entire table has been cleared. We had a large party so not everyone finished their meal at the same time, so we had to wait for everyone in the party to finish before seeing the desert menu. We thought that was so odd. Our waiter literally said he couldn't show us the dessert menu until everyone was done with dinner. We had one friend who then felt super rushed to finish his food and in the end ended up not even finishing his dinner just so everyone else could have dessert. I've never heard of such a thing. Food: DON'T go to the place hungry. The portions were so small we all left starving. For the price you pay, you get so ripped off on the quantity of food. I would say it had good flavor but honestly I don't even know because there was so little of it to taste. I was horrified when my ""hanger steak"" was literally a couple shavings of steak on a bed of cucumbers and red onion. Overall: The decor was nice for a special occasion but I will not be returning.

"Went this past Saturday with a small group of girls. 1) Service - Our waiter was nice but really did not seem to be that excited to be at work. I ordered a nice bottle of wine and when the waiter brought it over he poured each person a taste (not the person who ordered) and when we said it was fine - he left without pouring anyone a full glass.  When our appetizers arrived, we were given A fork - no knife - nothing - just forks set on the table.2) Food - appetizers where ""ok"" - the Kale Salad was good but not great and the scallops were so salty we had to send them back.  I had the black drum which, again, was so salty it was almost inedible. The presentation was horrible, just a brown clump of food next to a greenish/brown clump of food - just overall boring and not great.  My friend had the Agnolotti and said it was really good.3. Dessert - We ordered the Chocolat Au Lait and again, it was mediocre.Note: My daughter ordered the Fish & Chips off the bar menu and said it was really good...I have seen several stellar reviews and I will give Trace another chance - maybe - but our night was just OFF.",2.0 star rating
"This place is fantastic. The environment is very Southern California chic with indoor outdoor seating that transitions beautifully onto the street in a way that almost causes one to be unsure of where the seating actually begins. This seems to draw a person in and make them feel very comfortable. The food is other-worldly; well balanced, light and savory at the same time with attention paid in every detail down to the way the skillet potatoes are prepared (best I've ever had) even though they are normally rested as an after thought and mistreated sorely in other establishments. I've been here twice and it's on my list of must try in Austin.",5.0 star rating
"What a great experience! My friend had a coupon for 20% off and when she went with her friend to use it, they didn't apply the full amount. So my friend called and complained to the manager and the manager sure redeemed himself. His name is Michael. He said that next time she comes, that he will take care of her and some friends. And by taking care of her, he meant that our food and drinks were going to be on him. So we decided to take advantage of that offer but we had no idea what else he had in store for us. We decided to go during brunch this past Sunday. We had brunch at the restaurant and Gene was our waiter. He was great! Really took care of us. Not only that, but Michael said he had a cabana ready for us at the pool with Champagne! Say what!!! So as soon as we finished eating, some of the girls went to go change to get pool ready and leave their dogs at home. Oh by the way, you don't even have to take your dog home if you don't want to. They also have dog service, which means if you want to go to the pool, they will watch your dog. How cool is that! Not a lot of people know about this. Any ways, so we headed to the cabana, and it was the first one that sits by itself,right in front of the pool. It was amazing!!! So we enjoyed our champagne and we got a couple of bottles more after that. The last two bottles, we bought ourselves, we didn't want to overstay our welcome. So as were about to pay and leave, the second manager came by and offered a free bottle of Prosecco and that we were welcome to go downstairs to the bar. We took the Prosecco offer, but by that point we had to leave. We were there from 1 pm till 7:30 pm! We had no idea we were going to be staying there that long! It was time to call it quits but WOW, did they take care of us!!! We're definitely recommending this place to anyone! They treated us like princesses and we were 5 girls!

"My mom, my boyfriend, and I went here for lunch today, and though we had always enjoyed the food before, we were left disappointed. I ordered my 11 oz. ribeye medium rare, and it came out RARE. The quality of the meat was very questionable, as both my steak and my mom's were very fatty and quite tough in parts. My boyfriend foresaw the abysmal steak, and ordered ""smoked"" ribs. The claim that these ribs were smoked can easily be discredited by anyone with a basic knowledge of what smoking meat entails and what a smoked rib actually looks like. These were also sub-standard in flavor, as were the garlic mashed potatoes, which were drowning in garlic salt and completely devoid of fresh garlic. In addition to the poor quality of food, our server was forgetful and disoriented, having to be reminded several times that we asked for a side of ranch and that we ordered broccoli on the side. In the end, the meal we were provided with was not nearly worth the $75 we paid for it, and we will not be returning to what has become an overpriced, careless shadow of a Texas steakhouse.",2.0 star rating

Again, it took much longer than expected to get some glasses of wine and we ended up flagging down the server to ask where it was. We weren't in that much of a hurry that we expected service in a minute; however, 15+ minutes to get our drinks seems a bit long to me. I would guess the wine bar was about half full, so I'm not sure why it took so long exactly. Other than the lengthy service time, the actual wine was just fine and the setting was intimate. I noticed most people were there for dinner; however, we didn't try any of the food since we had reservations elsewhere.

"I recently coordinated and executed a work social event with Kelley and I have absolutely nothing but AMAZING things to say about the service, food and (obviously) the wine.  It's two days later and the group still hasn't stopped talking about how perfect the night was and what a great team builder it was (wine has that effect).  I attended the meatball festival about a year ago, where CRU took home first prize and requested these be served at our event.  Although they are not a part of the regular menu and the chef who created them has since moved on, Kelley went above and beyond by asking the current chef if he wouldn't mind including his own version - and he did. And they were delightful.  The wild mushroom pizza was incredible, and everyone continues to rave about the chicken satay and fritters with cinnamon and sugar. We have many social events here for our staff and this is one place I can guarantee we will be returning to, as often as the Finance Dept. will allow.  Thanks for a wonderful night Kelley and Cru staff!",5.0 star rating
"Straight up ballin'.I visited this place for brunch during restaurant week as a precursor to the Orange & White game and this place totally blew me away.  I got the Mimosa, steak & eggs, and french toast.  She got the White Sangria, grilled cheese, tomato soup, and chocolate lava cake.  First off the service was great but the scene was even better.  The trees on the patio provide just enough shade and would make you forget that you're in the city if it wasn't for the skyscrapers.  Now the food.  I thought the steak was good, just on the small side as far as portions are concerned.  Their home fries were the bomb and I thought the poached eggs were ok which was kinda interesting because I've never had a poached egg before.  The french toast though, wow.  It was pretty damn amazing.  However, with how happy I was with my order, my lady had the winning plate.  They have hands down the best grilled cheese and tomato soup I've ever had in my life.  I dont even know what it is... maybe crack in the soup?  crack in the cheese?  No idea and I dont care.  I could see myself coming back here for another sunday funday brunch.",5.0 star rating
"Well, first of all, I HATE places that have teeny 2-tops that require one person to face a wall 3 feet forward. I don't know if it's a painful memory of repeatedly standing in the corner throughout kindergarten or ingrained in my Sicilian blood to face the door but it's a serious pet peeve of mine. How much creativity does it take to let everyone in a people watching spot people watch.  If the crowd were any less attractive, I suspect my wife who otherwise could care less, might've switched seats with me.  Alas.On another note, the apps were definitely dinky tho in the range perhaps expected.  Seared tuna, caprese, and fondu all tasty - in fact the fondu, as much as it pains me to admit having (and having not facing anyone at that) was in fact very good (tho dinky - had to ask for more bread so we could finsh the lower half).The waiter kept walking off with the wine list - which added 5-10 minutes between glasses which wouldn't have been too bad if I could see some of the people behind me. Pretty odd for someone who you'd of thought would want me to keep drinking.  Perhaps he didn't want me to get a good look at the prices...""How's that?"", you ask.Turns out 3 of the six drinks (4 flights and 2 glasses, really) were more expensive on the bill compared to the menu (which he finally left with us after our last round).  Not by much, couple bucks apiece, but still pretty inexcusable.  The manager said, ""we change around our flights so often it's hard to keep straight"". Hope the IRS doesn't get word of that. Oh, and btw, Mr. Manager, as you may have noticed, 2 of the drinks were single, specific glasses of wine. Don't worry, I am sure they fixed their books immediately before overcharging any more customers. (also, I would have expected a break for their mistake, a free app, a coupon for another visit, something, but honestly, I don't think the manager particularly cared.  But I won't read too much into it.)All in all, nice enough, was a good time (but I credit my wife for most of that), atmosphere pretty decent despite my view, food small but good and not overly expensive for the type of place, wine was all quite nice, just watch your bill.",3.0 star rating

"I hadn't realized some wine bars actually had food, as is the case at Cru. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food here actually was.We stopped in late on a Saturday afternoon at that odd time after places close for lunch and before they open for dinner.  It was pretty deserted, only a couple of people there. The inside was quite attractive.To start, we had the heirloom tomato salad, crab cakes, fried brie, and ahi tuna. The tomato sald was good, the crab cakes very good, the tuna bleh, the fried brie absolutely scrumptious! (Although, it came with mushy green grapes, that's just wrong, no commercial food place should serve mushy grapes). I don't think I've ever had fried brie drizzled with honey before, I'm sad I've wasted so many years of my life without it. We had as ""entrees"" (their word) their portabello mushroom pizza and lamb rack. The pizza was very tasty... a little small, but not too bad as a one person appetizer. The lamb was tasty too, but much too chewy, and there were only two tiny pieces.We also had their patio and chardonnay wine flights. Both were good, there was only one wine I actively disliked of the six in the flights, and a couple I actually almost liked (I generally dislike wine and other alcoholic beverages where I can taste the alcohol, though I like the buzz).Oddly enough, they had no Schramsberg sparkling wines - I would have thought wine bars would have a wider selection of wines than restaurants.Service was very good.All in all, not a bad place... I wouldn't go here just for the food, but it's more than acceptable if you want to graze at an odd time, or if you like wine but also want something tasty with your drinks.Edit 8/23: Upgraded to 4 stars after trying a couple of other wine bars with no flights and worse food",4.0 star rating
"We went here once for a birthday dinner.  Being that we weren't that hungry, SO and I agreed to share something to be active eaters in the festivities.  We ordered the spinach salad and a pizza, and I got a reasonably-priced wine flight.  Not bad, not bad.The salad came out, and I was pretty sure the girl was going to say I was on Candid Camera.  When she didn't, I started counting how many pieces of spinach there were (15) and thought to myself man, if I had just brought some of that spinach I bought earlier today ($3.89/3lb container at Sam's) I would have some more to toss in here.  But I didn't, so SO and I each got 7.5 spinach leaves.The pizza was alright, albeit a little oily.  But you have to know that going into some pizza.  Definitely not Homeslice, but whatever.My most favorite ever part of dinner was when the bill came.  We all diligently wrote amounts on the back of the check to be swiped for our credit cards.  We all didn't realize gratuity had been added already, and only put down the amounts for our meals.  A little tipsy, we didn't notice we were $7 short of the bill that already had 18% gratuity included.  When the waitress saw this, she did what she had to.  Apparently thinking someone had written ""$125"" instead of ""$25"" she ran the card for that amount - $125 - giving herself a huge ginormous added tip.  Oh, that took some sorting out.  Eyes started blinking really wide and sobering up.  She eventually returned with the problem corrected, obviously upset about that bonus tip being so close, and yet so far.It was alright but... I've been to other wine bars I'd go to over this one.",2.0 star rating
"Cru was the 2nd wine bar on our Sunday wine crawl.   I wish I could say that I checked out their wine list, but I was blindsided by a Sunday special.  $15 will get you a 6 wine flight (3 reds and 3 whites) along with a cheese plate.   I enjoyed most of the wine and all but one cheese.  Wasn't a fan of the cheese that smelled like feet but the Chimay cheese and the Humboldt Fog were quite delicious.  The cheese plate also had a few slices of apple.  The waitress was very accommodating to the ladies in our group; she answered all of our questions in stride.    She made a couple of recommendations for other ladies in the group on what they should order, and both of the ladies were happy with their wines.   She did mention that they change up the wines and cheese each Sunday for the $15 special.   Cru has a nice patio with plenty of umbrellas for shade.  The inside of the restaurant appeared to be elegantly designed and would be a good setting for a romantic meal.",4.0 star rating

"This place has a great menu and great wine -- literally too many good things for me to eat in one sitting.  But if everything were eliminated but the cheese plate, I would still give it five stars.  And not just the cheese plate, but one particular cheese they serve -- an Italian cheese called Testun Ciuk (pronounced TEST-uhn CHOOK).Nutty, tangy, and intensely flavorful ... HEAVEN.  Please please please do me a favor and ask for it specifically when you go there, even if it's not on the menu.  Sometimes they have it anyway, and if people keep asking for it they will keep stocking it!I love the ambiance and the location too.  When the manager found out that we spoke food, he gave us all kinds of attention.  Great place.",5.0 star rating
"A friend of mine and I met here for a late night snack-and-drink to discuss some recent developments in his personal life, and I quite enjoyed my first visit. It's a cute little place, with indoor and outdoor seating. It's a bit loud, with fun music playing in the background, which suited our purposes just fine. The food and drinks are very nice. We each had a flight (I had champagne, he had pinot), and split a cheese tray. The champagne was quite nice, and my friend seemed to enjoy his wine. The cheeses and accompaniments were well-chosen, and the portions were plenty for two people to snack on. (Is it wrong that I really enjoyed fidgeting with the mini-cleaver that they brought out for the cheese? Choppity-chop!)As far as areas for improvement, the main thing I would mention is that it took quite some time for us to get water and to order our drinks. The server was quite friendly, and even went and got us an extra accompaniment to our cheese tray, but the pace of the service seemed a bit slow even though business was winding down (we showed up around 11:30 or so).Overall, though, I liked this place and would happily go back.",4.0 star rating

"I started with the potstickers appetizer, which was covered with little crunchy fried noodles, drizzled with some surprisingly tasty sauce, julienned peppers and veggies.  It was one of the tastiest things I've had recently.  Very nice.The Kobe beef was presented nicely, subtly seasoned, but a bit on the tough side, which I would have brought to their attention had anyone inquired about the quality of my meal.Chocolate mousse desert trio was good overall (and hard to really screw up, IMO). I decided to save the best for last, so chose my order as white, milk, dark chocolate.  The white chocolate tasted like vanilla protein shake with a store-bought icing finish - really, horribly bad, and I actually thought I'd rather have spent the calories elsewhere, after finishing it.  The milk chocolate was surprisingly rich and good, so much so, that I expected more from the dark chocolate than it was able to deliver.  The dark chocolate had a thinner, lighter texture, which seemed a bit of a letdown, but in fairness, had a very rich and nice bitter flavor.Overall, quite well done.  Not the full makings of a 5-star experience, but very good.  I had a lovely time, and therefore award the 5th star to my beautiful and talented Jill W.",4.0 star rating

"Trace is beautiful. Everyone knows the W has style, and this restaurant inside is no different. Very modern & sexy. It's definitely dressed to impressed, and I loved the patio view with huge lit up trees and the sounds of the city. My boyfriend snatched up a half off deal for here, and to be honest, I probably would have never stepped my foot in the doors without it. The server was friendly and we had a great time, but I can't imagine going back for the food at full price. The good: Sea Bass Crudo & Crab Cakes. The crab cakes come with a tomatillo jam that was a surprise hit, and the sea bass crudo had a nice presentation and interesting flavors. These were the only two items that we got that got close to wowing me. At Trace, I felt like I was going to get the fine dining experience, and these two plates came the closest. The okay: Bluebonnet Salad (pine nuts & figs are always good, but nothing special), garlic fries with the fanciest ketchup I ever seen. The really not good: Brussel sprouts. I had seen them on Yelp as a must try so I did! The sauce was so rich and the brussel sprouts weren't as cooked as I prefer. I couldn't finish them, and that's pretty rare.  And one more random thing? I called before to see if they validated parking and I got this answer: ""Yes, we validate for valet."" Maybe I'm just a silly youngin', but I thought this meant free. No, this means $7 + tip. FYI!",3.0 star rating

"Best for Sundays when your feeling bougie and want to be waited on by the best looking men in Austin. These were the first two elements about Trace that I walked away with fresh in my mind. Speaking of fresh, all the dishes I have tried from this place from the handful of times I have gone have been explosions of taste, technique, and good genuineness in my mouth. From what I can tell every plate is made with the best ingredients and freshly prepared  when you order. And they know how to plate the dishes so that you are left with a full belly and a piece of art on our phone after to take a snap shot. Cocktails, cocktails, cocktails. The bartender is your best friend here filling every drink order to the brim with the best in the liquor cabinet. Their mimosas are awesomely good but crazy strong so watch out! Finally, the wait staff and so kind and curious and DROP DEAD GORGEOUS. Ladies this is where it's at for your sex in the city needs. Great job Trace!!!",4.0 star rating
"1.) I love the W Hotel. 2.) I *tolerate* its Living Room Lounge, with its particular see-and-be-seen brand of yuppie absurdity. But they serve alcohol, so, I tend to look past all that.   3.) I am now presently able to say I am a true fan of the restaurant Trace, especially if what you are seeking out is a light lunch with decent fare in modern surroundings.    Trace played host to the last meal I would have with my friend visiting from California. After another round of interviews and a flight back home just hours away, we decided to spend our last few moments together on 2nd Street, where we agreed to hit up Trace for an early meal.    We were a little too early, as the restaurant did not open until 11:30 AM, so we had some time to kill. I showed her around the lounge, where we were the only people around. It felt a little eerie, mostly because I'm used to the particular din of pretentious young professionals nursing cocktails while intently scanning the room for dating and/or networking opportunities. Instead it was just us, relaxing in front of a roaring fire, even though it was probably 95° outside. If people ever ask me ""What do you do on Thursday mornings?"" I can now honestly answer with: ""Sometimes I lounge on the sofas of the deserted W Hotel and have a friend take photos of me in front of a fireplace that make me resemble Satan."" They can process this information however they wish.   Not surprisingly, we were the first to be seated, promptly at 11:30 AM. We chose a middle table that kind of straddled being indoors and outdoors, so we could get a feel for both spaces. We technically had the entire place to ourselves, until around midway through the meal when another couple joined us on the patio. Which is always nice, since I prefer the undivided attention from waiters. And really, who invited THEM? Oh well. Although the Cobb salad and the Trace Butcher Burger both lobbied hard for my vote, we both decided to try Trace's ""Lunch on the Fly': A choice of soup, salad and sandwich (either the veggie pakora burger or smoked beef brisket). If we could win an Olympic medal for synchronized ordering throughout the years, we'd probably take gold, as we again both opted for the brisket, spring salad, and the chilled corn soup. (You are able to order warm doughnuts to go for a little extra, but I suggested Delish for dessert instead). Our food was out quite fast as I recall, which one would expect from a ""lunch on the fly"". *We* weren't particularly rushed at that moment, but I could see some people from the surrounding office buildings appreciating the quick, simple lunch option they've got going on. Much like other restaurants in the area, the 3-course prix fixe ""business lunch"" thing is probably very wise to offer, what with all the busy, busy bees buzzing around downtown. The brisket sandwich was wonderfully moist, tasty, and not over-sauced, although to be quite honest, the portion could have been a little more generous. I am aware it's lunch-sized, but even as someone who practices portion control, I would probably have pegged the right amount to be about 50% larger to achieve full meal satisfaction. The spring salad was just alright, but the corn soup made up for it; its chilled flavors definitely made for a perfect summer soup, and it was nicely presented to boot. The inside of Trace looked very nice, and even though we chose the patio this time around, I am curious as to what the interior ambiance is like in the evening. I regret not being able to join Errol M. and Melissa A. on a Friday they invited me for dessert, because apparently they were enjoying themselves and they thought I'd think the waiter was cute. Damn it; I'm still pissed I was unavailable for that. But I love that I have friends who ""get"" me. We'll have to try that again.   Our service was adequate, in that our server was pleasant and our iced teas stayed refilled. The initial host who seated us was also very inviting. We asked a different hostess on the way out if Trace validated parking for City Hall, and while she said ""Yes"", the handwritten signature on the parking ticket ended up being unofficial...as the surly parking lot attendant did not hesitate to inform us of ten minutes later. He still let us through, so I suppose she did us a favor. Although I'm not sure if this could actually be repeated. Actual results may vary.To sum up: Nice venue. Decent lunch. Good vibes all around. Next time I stop in, it'll be for dinner. I feel their house made charcuterie platters and Niman ranch strip steak are calling my name. Or, I'll meet some friends for dessert and judge whether or not the waiters are hot. Either way, I'm sure it'll be a win-win.  4 Stars.",4.0 star rating

"After a satisfying, if extraterrestrial, experience at Mulberry, someone wanted to go see the new Willie Nelson statue.  Yes, the adventurous one.  Me.It's a very long walk from Third and Nueces to Second and Lavaca on a warm Sunday afternoon.  But, of course, you don't mind walking because you're keeping the company of three kind and stunningly gorgeous ladies.When you arrive, you'll find you might get thirsty, since there's such a long line to get your picture taken with Willie.  Fortunately, there's this little corner lemonade stand.  With a band.  And an air-conditioned lounge.The lemonade is peculiar.  It is infused with cucumber.  And jalapeno.  And one of the Jacksons.  It is very, very tasty.  Makes you want to open your own stand.  And then you find you can't.There was a great band playing a variety of 70s and 80s music outside.  It wasn't all mainstream stuff, fortunately.  If you do album-only jazz fusion tracks from Steely Dan, you really get my notice.The lounge interior is elegant, and plush.  It's a place you could spend an hour or two alone--in excellent company, of course!  Sadly, my sojourn was far briefer, which guarantees a return trip.I like this little lemonade stand.  But you may want to check with the proprietor.  I discovered there are certain non-lemonade specials that are remarkably priced on Sunday afternoon.  Be sure to ask about them before ordering from the provided bar specialties menu.  You may change your mind about the lemonade.  Especially if you're extra thirsty.",5.0 star rating

"This is a review of the brunch. At first glance, the menu looked a bit boring, but I later discovered that it's because they use locally sourced, organic ingredients. One cannot expect to find a bounty of ingredients in the mid of winter here.Trace is elegantly decorated, with modern sophistication. The booths are made with luxurious velvet fabric and very comfortable. The restaurant is bright and clean. There was a live band playing Jazz music. The music gave the entire restaurant this warm, happy, upscale feel. We started brunch with complimentary Bloody Marys and mimosas. The drinks were good and gave us a chance to leisurely peruse the small menu. The food, although simple, was spectacular. The pastry basket was filled with goodies. The standout for me was the spicy jalapeno corn muffin-sweet, salty, and spicy. My favorite was the corned-beef hash. The hash was more stew-like and the chunks of corned beef were very tender. The Farmers breakfast was so hearty and the fried green tomatoes and cheesy grits just brought back one of the pleasant memories on a farm outside of Jackson, MS. I can go on and on about the food, but you must try it for yourself.Here are a couple pointers so you won't be disappointed1-this is a fine dining restaurant so don't expect to pay IHop prices for what appears to be very humble food. I thought the prices were extremely reasonable for a downtown location in a nice hotel.2-the menu is limited because what can be locally sourced is limitedYou won't go ""ooh and ah"" over the food or stellar presentation.

"Had an absolutely fab time my last evening in Austin at Cru. It had been a week full of social activities, so it was nice to grab a quiet table for two here with my husband and chill out together. We fell in love with the spot! Where to begin? Impeccable service. From the hostess (who seated us promptly and explained each of the menus), to the servers (really friendly and at the ready to clear empty dishes), to the guy who filled the water glasses. The menu was absolutely enticing, and we decided to get an array of small plates for the variety. Started off with a cheese plate -- there were four options and the Sinful was a great choice. Generous cheese portions, though a little skimpy on the apple, grapes and honeycomb. We also ordered an item from the chef's special menu: Goat cheese beinets. A soft fried outer crust gave way to creamy goat cheese. Smother them in the drizzled honey and crushed black pepper that's on the plate; tasted super-sexy. As did the mussels -- must have been around 30 of them, plus a loaf of bread that was perfect for dipping in all that delicious garlicky broth served in the hot pot. God, what else... the ahi tuna. I've had ahi at three different places in the last week, and this was the best by far. Served with a brown and orange sauce that was subtle, but a little tangy and a little spicy. We each had a wine flight (three glasses, 2-oz pours). I went with a white; hubs with a red, and we shared. The variety of paired tastes and textures made for a meal I never wanted to end.",5.0 star rating
This place has taken a turn for the worst.  The service is abysmal with little college aged kids who come by the table far to frequently.  Clearly the management has decided that cutting corners and saving money and not providing customers with value is in their best interest; case in point their capresse appetizer:A dish which 6 months ago was a nice thick chunk of sweet tomato followed by a thick slice of wonderful buffalo mozzarellaA week ago it was a bunch of tiny cherry tomatoes diced up with miniscule chunks of cheese- paltry in comparison and a total joke and rip-off.  I will never go back to this place...what a joke!!!And to top it all off the server asked me if I wanted change when I handed her a $50 on a $41 bill right in front of me and my date...appalling and rude!!I think you get the point this place is trendy and posh but low class!!!!,1.0 star rating
"The weather is great, so we decided to drive around downtown and see if we like any outdoor patios. After 15 minutes driving around, we decided to check out CRU. It's close to Taverna. It's a wine bar. We got there pretty early enough to have half price happy hour menu The waiter brought several wine menu, but we don't drink. I guess he must be disappointed. Who will go to a wine bar without ordering wine. I just want to sit outside.We ordered steamed mussels, crab cake, steak pizza and banana brulee split. Every dish is wonderful, especially steamed mussels and banana brulee split. Mussels are as good as what I had in Belgium, the best mussels I had in Austin. Dessert is very tasty and creative, banana brulee. Who go that idea? Mixed with ice cream and toasted pecans. And it's only $4.25.The waiter is very nice and came to explain about French wine they have. He also talked about the restaurant name - CRU. It's a premium French winery area. He also mentioned one day one guy came and ordered a $300 wine and brought his own $6000 champagne. A bottle of champagne costs $6000? Unbelievable.",4.0 star rating
"My husband and I were looking for a way to celebrate our 12th anniversary and after perusing the menus around the Domain, decided the wine bar would be something fun.  We weren't quite sure what to expect, but we were pleased overall.We each decided on a wine flight--he the Sexy Reds, and I, the Patio Whites.  We thought the cards were fun to read about the wines as we tasted.  We wished we could have them as a keepsake!  But our waitress took them away.  We also enjoyed the All American cheese plate, which was nice and we felt fancy for the parents of three young kids who rarely get out!After our wine flight, we each picked one to get a glass of for our dinner, which was a great, thin crust, portobello mushroom pizza.  Perfect size for us to share after eating so much cheese.We easily rung up a tab of $100, which we thought was high, but for special occasions, what the heck!",4.0 star rating

"OK, I know it's a little pricey. I also know it's located as what I've dubbed ""Little Dallas"" (the 2nd Street District), but kids, if you're looking for an upscale glass of juice, this is a nice place to drink it down. My mate and I each had a flight. Her's was the ABC (Anything But Chardonay), mine, the California Dreamin' (reds from Cali). I ordered mine because it had my all-time favorite, Ridge Lyton Springs. My mate ordered hers because it had her all-time favorite, which I don't remember because I don't like white wine, so who cares? (And this makes spot number two to offer my favorite wine by the glass, which even my only-white-loving-friend declared ""Lovely. Oh...that's just...lovely.""Seriously, she discovered Stump Jump from this, and that is a fine white wine. We also had the All-American Cheese flight, as well as the calamari (slightly spicy--rings only, no tentacles) and chocolate fondue (semi-sweet). Our server was incredibly knowledgeable when we asked about everything we ordered (with great recommendations), and he was amazingly attentive...until the hot blondes with Gucci purses entered. Then we turned into the chopped liver that wasn't even offered on the menu.Oh well. We're hot in our own right and still had a fantastic time on a random night out. Neither of us had been out for a ""fancy"" night in a while and we felt like we deserved it. Our consensus was that we would not only come back, but we'd recommend it to out of town guests. Hey, that's a pretty big compliment from two stuck-up food and wine bitches...",4.0 star rating
"Since moving downtown about a year ago, Cru Wine Bar has become one of our ""go to"" places, both for our own casual dining and sharing with friends and family.  The wines are great, but you would expect that in a wine bar!  We all enjoy the flights that allow you to try three different variations in a given wine, and have discovered some new favorites that way.  The surprise is how good the food is. We are particularly fond of the fondue (blended cheeses and wine with a great variety of dipping materials) and I am personally addicted to their pan seared Scottish salmon filet over couscous.  The citron sauce on this dish is amazing, and the small bits of fruit in the couscous make it a delightful part of the taste profile, rather than just something on the side.  My husband enjoys the pan roasted chicken piccata and our guests have flipped over the pizzas, caprese salad and lamb lollipops.  They don't take reservations, so we go early, but have never had a hard time getting seated.  The service has been consistently good and occasionally they even have an acoustic guitarist who does a lovely job.",4.0 star rating
Came here during First Night on New Year's Eve and were lucky enough to get a table without a reservation. Cru was offering a reasonable prix fixe menu and it made for a good way to start out the evening. Their wine flights were an inventive way to sample several varieties without ordering separate full glasses. They had enough of a selection that most anyone would find something they'll like. The food was on par with the price: my wife had a scallop that was cooked to perfection and my sea bass was pretty good. We were both pleasantly surprised at how good the food was considering Cru is a wine bar chain. The service was friendly and competent even though it was New Year's Eve and the place was pretty busy. Overall our trip to Cru was a pleasant experience and we'd consider going back.,3.0 star rating
"Alright, so it's a little pricey, but I really enjoy coming here for good wine and cheese.The first time, I was here to celebrate a friend's engagement, and enjoyed a flight of wine. It was a great setting to celebrate with a small group of people.Came back a second time with the BF for a glass of wine and some cheese. I stuck with the Classic Cheese flight, because I prefer the harder nuttier cheeses as opposed to the soft, creamy cheeses. Perfect!Was back here recently to share the same cheese flight with a couple of girlfriends. Our waiter was really nice and attentive, and just let us take our time. It made for a really relaxing evening.Overall, I like the setting the service and choices, but it can get pretty crowded on the weekends, and it doesn't take long to run up an expensive bill!",4.0 star rating
"I wouldn't even bother, but everyone else loved it, so I am moved to provide some balance.PRO - The room is pretty.CON - The wine is too expensive.  It's not that I went to a wine bar on a beer joint budget, it's that they have marked everything up too much.The waitstaff (I sat at the bar) knew virtually nothing about anything on the wine list.  They spent most of their time discussing various gyms and their workouts, in the way self absorbed, sullen, younger people in the service industry sometimes do.This entire area makes me regret any zoning variances or economic incentives the city may have given the developers.  If I want Dallas, I'll go to Dallas. Cru, Taverna, that chain Mexican place . . . UGH!",2.0 star rating
Our waitress Katie was a pleasant and fun girl to have a conversation with. One of the highlights was that a bottle we wanted was out of stock so they suggested another bottle of prosecco for a similar price which was not on the menu. I like this Cru more than the Domain one -- this one has a more intimate and less suburban feel.,4.0 star rating
"This is my FAVORITE wine bar in the downtown area.  You just cannot beat the flights at Cru -- all of the wines I had on my flight of Riesling were amongst the best I had ever tasted.  Not to mention that the glasses get served to you on this gorgeous silver metal contraption that allows the water to hold the handle a top and safely transport 3 - 6 wine glasses.  If they sold these things to the general public, I'd buy ten for myself and one for each and every one of my friends.  Fantastic cheese plate, too.  Not particularly unique pairings, but excellent selection and a fairly generous serving size.  The best part about Cru is that it is located in the super trendy new 2nd Street District.  It's just sooo fun to sit out on the patio -- I go here when I want to reminisce about all the time I spent eating at sidewalk cafes while living in Paris. It's also a great spot to do some prime people watching -- lots of new money, lots of Texas-style yuppies, and lots of... well, Austinites!  You know what I mean.",4.0 star rating
"This place feels too much like Dallas for my liking. I've only been once, but overall wasn't that impressed. I do like the outdoor patio, but 2nd Street feels like it can be Anywhere, USA. The wine list itself was decent, but then again, so are many other places in town.I'd probably come back for pre-dinner drinks on the patio, but doubt I would spend a whole evening here. I spend enough time in Dallas during the week for work, and I have no desire to replicate that ""experience"" while I'm in Austin.",3.0 star rating
"Was hesitant about Cru given that it's part of zippy restaurant group, and one out of Dallas, but gave it a try, and I stopped hatin.'Nice space inside, very well lit and organized like a lounge, but not cold and sleek. Sprawled with some peeps on some couches and small tables, and shared an excellent cheese fondue and some Moroccan meatballs. Service was hectic but warm. She pulled it together.Snazzy joint next to Jos on 2nd street. If you're thinking about going to Taverna, try this one first.",4.0 star rating
"I hate myself a little more every time I say ""I should come here when I'm on expense account"". It signals twisted values and a loss of all perspective. But mostly it's because I never have an expense account.    Service and atmosphere were impressive - it was a treat to see a waiter deftly refuse a young group of buzzed but obviously rich kids.    The flights are a good deal (between $10-$19 for 3 wines), with lots of flights to pick from and interesting themes tying great wines together. Pick from any of the wines on the flight list if you want to order a full glass (again, about $10-$19 for a full-pour).  It *seems* like the flights get you more for the money, but perception is a tricky thing when filtered through a few Zins.    Off the flight lists, everything is by-the-bottle. Reasonable for a very good wine bar, not reasonable for a night of bar-hopping. I haven't tried any food except the cheese plate, which was solid but on the pricey side.    Now all I have to do is find someone willing to pay me to drink there.",4.0 star rating
"I have been hesitating to Yelp about Cru since it's not exactly a local spot, but I can't hold back any longer. This is just a high class stop! I love the seating arrangements and this was my 3rd or 4th visit with friends and it was exceptional. Our little waitress was really sweet and patient and the food was delicious. Their flights are creative and really not too expensive so don't hesitate and come on in!Recently we also enjoyed a small private party in their teeny room in the back, but it was cozy and comfortable and they decanted all the wine which made a nice touch. Cru is great and now has to go on my Acceptable Chains list. I think they also are in Denver, Chicago, Dallas and the Woodlands. Don't miss their steamed mussels.

"BiteSquad delivery while watching NFL playoffs at Home on Sunday.$60 total all in and when the driver handed it to me I thought about how light it felt.18"" pizza (half Austin / half Diavola) veal meatballs, kale salad.Started with the pizza. We certainly would have finished it and more if we liked it better. 18 inches is the length. The width is half that.The crust in unusual. The taste is good but the texture is wrong for me. It is soft, easy to chew and stretchy. More like a dinner roll texture I guess. I like thin, crispy with a bit of chew.The Diavola was liked more than the Austin. Basically the Diavola is a hot pepperoni with tomato. The Austin is sausage, tomato, red pepper, jalapeño.I like Italian fresh sausage on my pizza. Fry up the spicy ground meat and drop it on top of the pizza, yum! 28 uses a processed meat that is chopped up in chunks. DNL - did not like.The meatballs were the high point. Smallish tender balls of juicy ground veal. A little marinara and cheese. We gobbled them down and loved.The $10 kale salad was very weak. A small amount of leaves with full stems attached mostly longer than the leaves. A few olives, peppers, garbanzo beans and tasteless dressing on the side. At least dress it. Kale is very sturdy and can hold a dressing a long time. Disappointing.All in all I would only return for the meatballs.Btw, I know it was delivery but I only live 2 miles away and BiteSquad delivered promptly. The food temperature was good, the food not so much. Maybe better in the restaurant but I'm not heading there any time soon.",3.0 star rating

"I love me some Numero 28.  Sometimes we refer to it in the office as Numero 29, but that would mean something was 1 better than Numero 28, which just isn't the case.The meatballs are delicious and all of their pizzas are very good.  The spinach salad with beets is super delicious. I try to get it every time I go in to make myself feel like I am making healthy choices.Spinach salad with lasagna sounds healthy to me!Start off with some prosciutto as it is always delicious.  I find their mozzarella very boring, so I usually skip it. Also skip the gelato, not sure if it sits out for too long, but there is something off about it.  Even my 14yr old didn't love it.I would much rather have a plate of meatballs vs. the gelato.  I could eat the aracina and meatballs every day.  The beef carpaccio is very tasty.If you're looking for fancier Italian food head to Italic, but if you want good old fashioned Italian comfort food at a reasonable price Numero 28 is the place to be.",4.0 star rating

I confirmed to make sure I got a second glass. ""More like 2:15."" He noted.I guess he was in a hurry to get home for a bong hit.  And that's ok.

"I had a VERY different experience. 1) I swear that there were 20 people working while there were 8 guests, 3 tables, 2) #1 is important bc the service was awful, 3) after ordering glasses of wine we watched them sit on a tray for AT LEAST 10 minutes before finding their way to our table, 4) once we drank the wine, it took forever to get another and was never asked if we were interested in another...had to flag the guy down (we were waiting for him to come out from behind the gelato freezer, which no one was eating gelato), 5) meatballs hit the table. They were fabulous! With the meatballs came bread. We were curious if it was sourdough with a hard crust like we like so we fingered every piece (more on that later), 6) lack of service and lack of table cleaning ensues, 7) pizza comes and again was GREAT! We got the Austin, FYI, 8) all of this was fine and. It really wasn't worthy of a review UNTIL we were asked if we were done with our bread...nodded yes, ZERO SHAME, ZERO attempt to hide it, he took our bread basket, threw out the half eaten piece and dumped the uneaten, although fingered, bread into the bucket of bread from which he served tables.

"I ate here Tuesday night with 2 companions.  The tables were full and we sat at the bar, which was fine with us.  The {cooks/hosts/owners}? were dynamite.  They made useful suggestions.  We started with some cheese and sliced meats which were all good.  Then we got a medium pizza and I ordered lasagna bolognese, probably because I think I remember Jack saying it was great, and his opinions on trucks, motorcycles, and women are all spot on.  Both pizza and lasagna were dynamite, but it was a lot of food for 3 of us.  The gelato station near the door was appealing, but we were just too full.  Next time the plan is to eat lighter and get some of that.  And, not only was the food great, the guys behind the bar made it fun with their comments, suggestions and general chatter.   I've eaten so many places in Austin where the people working there just don't look like they're happy doing their job, so this was a big bonus and made for a enjoyable meal that surpassed the food alone.",4.0 star rating

"What a great date night!  Newer to Austin, we felt like we were livin' in Austin style last night.  We walked to an early show at the Violet Crown where we saw Meru, a beautifully shot film about three climbers' attempts at scaling the very difficult Meru in India.  Then, although I walk by the No. 28 Restaurant many times/week, we had never been to try it.  It has been on my list but thinking it was a Pizza place, it never seemed like the right selection.  Pizza isn't my favorite food group.  Last night was the night.  It was a beautiful evening; we sat outside.  Our waitress suggested the Porketta which my Italian husband had to try.  It is a favorite dish of his and it was beautifully prepared--a nice crust, very flavorful seasonings with the parsley and garlic interior.  It was paired with red cabbage--very well done and frites.  My husband thought it was as good as Porketta he has had in Rome.  I had the Arugula Salad which was excellent-fresh and full of flavor.    We brought a Margarita Pizza home for our daughter which she and her friend came home from watching the disappointing Longhorn game to devour.  Yelp's excellent reviews for this spot, were on point in our opinion.  This small and easy to miss place is MUCH more than a local pizza spot.  They are serving up some really nice meals.  We will definitely become regulars.  One of the better options on 2nd Street if you're in that part of town.  Prices are 2nd street level but reasonable for the quality.",4.0 star rating

"Cru was our location to ring in the new year.  I have not had the pleasure of eating in many fine restaurants, so I jumped at the opportunity this time.  For a reasonable price we were offered a 4 course meal.  We also decided to do flights of wine, to give us some variety -- especially for me, who again, does not have a lot of experience in the wine world.  I went with some whites, which were delicious.  I really appreciate the variety, which allowed me to be exposed to more tastes and types.  He went for the pinot noirs, which I surprisingly really enjoyed. Our meal started with an appetizer of crawfish and black eyed peas.  It was much better than I had expected.  Nice flavor, not too heavy.  A perfect start to the meal.  For the second course, I went with the Lemon Butter Poached Tiger Shrimp, served on a bed of risotto style couscous.  I love shrimp and risotto, so I was sure I would enjoy this.  And I was correct, the flavors were unbelievable.  Rich, but not too heavy, the butter was just the right amount.  The couscous was cooked perfectly, a little al dente, no mushiness at all.  The spices were faint, which allowed me to enjoy the natural flavor of the shrimp, which were also cooked perfectly.  It is very hard for me to find shrimp that is cooked perfectly for my taste, but Cru succeeded in this.  Next came the entree - I picked the Tenderloin of Beef, served with a bacon-potato cake and leeks.  The beef melted in my mouth.  I couldn't get enough of it.  And when tasted with some of the potato pancake, it was even better.  I must say, this is probably the best entree I have ever had and I know I will want it again soon.  Dessert was a molten lava cake, which was good, but nothing extraordinary, but perhaps by the time dessert arrived I was too full to truly enjoy it.  The atmosphere was nice, romantic, and had perfect lighting.  I enjoy the dim lights and quiet music, as well as the little candle floating in a champagne glass placed in the center of our table.  We were also provided with party hats, noise makers, and a glass of champagne for the midnight toast.Overall, it was a great experience, perfect for a memorable new years eve.  I definitely plan on going to Cru again, and taking advantage of their wine tastings.",5.0 star rating

The pear and Gorgonzola pizza was divine, and my only complaint is that their wines by the glass are a tad pricey, but it's also my fault for ordering Spanish reds.

"I like wine.  I like food.  I like wine and food with suggested flights and pairings; however, I don't like to walk into an establishment and kinda be shunned off b/c the waitress is either not having a good night, or just doesn't feel like doing her job (i.e. coming up to the table to just set stuff down and not make any eye contact or conversation is weird for a waitress).  Outside of that, you can tell Cru is a chain...it's predictable.  Good wines and overpriced food.  Would I make this place a regular?...nope.   BUT, this place would be good for a first date.",2.0 star rating

"This place has a nice wine list, as expected. That aside, the service is excellent and the scallops are to die for. If you are into brunch and are standing in front of Taverna (next door), get out of line and walk over to Cru. Taverna is packed with people who want to be seen - not people who enjoy brunch. Cru is the place to go for excellent food. The only negative thing I have to say is that it is a smidge too pricy. Don't get me wrong - I will continue to go and love it, but I enjoy a little more value in what I consume.",4.0 star rating
"My wife and I went for the Eat Out for Good set menu and really enjoyed the experience!  We arrived about 30 min before our reservation due to ligth traffic and they went out of their way to accomodate us despite the presence of a crowd left from Happy Hour.  Manager came over immediately to welcome us and explained they are setting up another table for us.  The bar tender served water while we looked at the wine list and moved everything to the table for us.  The service was very friendly and efficient.  The Goat Cheese Beignets Amuse Bouche were amazing, the Diver Scallop and Ahi Tartare appetizers were very tasty, the Braised Angus Short Ribs and Pan Roasted Rack of Lamb were delicious, the Molten Chocolate Cake and Crème Brûlée were perfect endings to our meal.  Even the side dishes were great!  The wine flights were reaonably priced and introduced us to great new wines.   It was simply a perfect gastronomical experience!  We will definitely be back for more!",5.0 star rating
"My husband and I stopped by for a 'nibble and sip' while window shopping on a Sunday afternoon and had a lovely time! Not to be Pollyanna but it was just one of those 'what a lovely afternoon to sit on a patio and doing a little people watching with a N&S?' and what did we find on the menu but a Patio Wines wine flight!?! We also had the classic cheese flight and the steam mussels, both were delish.",4.0 star rating
I'd seriously give this place negative stars if I could. The service was terrible and the food was less than impressive. Not only did they run out of menus for Sunday brunch but they didn't have coffee cups available until 30 minutes after they brought us our coffee. The restaurant was half empty and it was not even noon yet  - how do you not have enough menus for customers and how have you not washed your coffee cups for the morning rush? Also - bottomless mimosas aren't so bottomless when your server fails to come by to refill them. As for the food - the portions were small and the food was subpar. I ordered a ham and cheese panini and received soggy bread with two slabs of ham and what appeared to be invisible cheese inside. It also took over an hour for us to get our food. I think McDonalds or the free continental breakfast at my hotel would have been a way better option.The only redeeming quality this place has is its outdoor patio if you can get there early enough to stake out a table. Oh and the water guys. They should hire them to run the restaurant because they were the most competent employees there.,1.0 star rating
"We eat out at least 3 times a week and this is without a doubt the worst service I've ever had.  Food was in extremely small portions and honestly nothing to write home about.  No reason given and no apologies from anyone for what turned into a 2 hour dinner because they were so slow getting anything to us... including the drinks.  Even if we went back and the service was suddenly outstanding, it wouldnt be worth it.  Just because you make your portions small and pretty, that doesnt make them taste any better.  I'm taking my ""Cru"" somewhere else.",1.0 star rating
"i'd been walking around allll morning seeing the sights in austin (UT, the capitol..) and was looking forward to a cold fountain drink and some food to refuel me for the rest of the day.  originally planned on going to frank, but since they were serving brunch that meant no hot dogs. boo.  wandered down to the next block and saw this place.  which wich has a big menu of sandwich meats on the wall (ham, turkey, chicken, pork, beef, veg), and basically from there you add on your fixings (sauces, veggies, salt and pepper, etc), checking off everything on the paper bag your sandwich eventually gets served into.  load up to your heart's content.  all sandwiches are over-toasted and cost $5, and theyve got chips, cookies, sodas, milkshakes too.if i get the chance before leaving town would totally come back and try something else.",4.0 star rating
"I hate sandwich places, but I love this one. I happened to be in the neighborhood at lunchtime with a very tight timeframe to eat.  I started to wait in line at Jo's and gave up.  Which wich was the first alternative I came across on the next block.  Although the method for ordering was a little intimidating at first, the directions on the signs were clear.  Just fill out exactly what you wanted on  the bag and turn it in to the cashier. The sandwich choices were yummy and the condiments genius - you get exactly what you want and there is no one to look at you askance or judge.  Am I the only person on the planet who doesn't put cheese on a sandwich?   The adorable cashier gave me a big smile and had  me checked out in seconds with no judging on my sandwich choices. What more could a fussy Virgo  in a hurry ask for?  Anyway, I got Turkey with coleslaw and 1000 island dressing, with olive paste, mustard, no fat mayo and peppers.  DEEE- LICIOUS!!. I had to make a really important meeting in less than 25 minutes, but I got my sandwich and ate it with plenty of time to spare -- right in the middle of lunchtime rush.  MmMMMMmmmmm.  And  I ate the whole thing.",4.0 star rating
"The concept for ordering (writing it down on the bag and then handing it to them) is kinda fun and creative. The sandwiches are quite tasty.The service, however, was surprisingly rude. I didn't realize that I had to fill out a *separate* form to order a milkshake, so when I went up to the counter with my sandwich order and asked if I could have a milkshake, the guy heaved a big sigh, rolled his eyes dramatically, stomped over to pick up a form, and then handed it to me.  He then stood there and waited for me to fill out the form to officially indicate that I wanted a milkshake.It's cool that the restaurant has a strange, funky system for ordering, but don't give your customers crap if they don't nail it the first time.  All I wanted was to give them money and get a milkshake in return. When I got back to the table and was talking about what had happened, my fellow luncher explained that she had the same thing happen with her cookie order.The food was delicious, but the experience was so disheartening and discouraging that I can't imagine I'd ever go back.  It turned an otherwise positive experience into a complete downer.",2.0 star rating
"Every time I go to Which Wich, I get the shrimp po'boy.  No, I have never gotten any other sammich at any Which Wich.  Why?  Because I'm not sure anything else would taste better.  While the shrimp tastes very good for a chain restaurant, the bread detracts from the sandwich.  I dunno, it's too... sour, or something.  I love sourdough bread, but I don't think shrimp tastes right with sourdough bread.  Does Which Wich even technically USE sourdough bread??  Their website says white and wheat, so I don't know what to think.  Even for what might be sourdough bread, Which Wich's bread is almost TOO sour.My comments about their bread not only relate to this particular location, they extend to all locations.  I've eaten at two other locations (Parmer, Triangle).  Despite the bread being so lackluster, I've been to various Which Wich locations ten or so times.  The shrimp tastes good enough that I can almost ignore the inferior bread, I guess.Apparently I'm the only one experiencing the bread issue, as I didn't see it mentioned in any other review of any other location.They do have pretty good chocolate shakes, and I like the pea-sized ice from the ice machine.The best part about Which Wich is the very original ordering process.  Yeah, there's more work involved for the customer, but it means having less interaction with the employees, which some people like.  It also means having the freedom to try to make people laugh or choke on their food by writing funny, stupid, or scandalous names on the bags to be read aloud.  Names like, ""Peter Piper's Pickled Porn Princess"", ""D.B. Cooper"", Xhcgetfkonsg"", or ""F*** You, Michael Dell!""",3.0 star rating

"I have a confession to make:  I think I ate a Which Wich sandwich once a day for the entire first week after I moved into my apartment.  But how could I resist when they are sooo darn good??  Before moving here, I was accustomed to Potbelly's sandwiches, which are perfectly fine, but they just don't give you enough options so it's easy to get bored with their selection.  Which Wich has the opposite problem - they are the masters of sandwich customization, which can lead to the ultimate lunchtime dilemma... which meat?  what cheese?  what veggies?  They have literally 50 different options on the main ingredient (a million meats, veggie options, PB&J, etc).   I haven't let myself cave in on any of the ""so good but soooo bad for you"" options yet, but I fairly regularly get the tomato & avocado or the black bean patty (which vegetarians will be pleased to hear is actually good and has flavor).  Which Wich has single handedly destroyed my ability to eat at Subway, Quiznos and Potbelly's.  My only real complaint is that they don't yet have nutrition information posted on their website, but they say it is ""coming soon"" and in the meantime you can get an idea from dailyplate or other websites of that nature.",5.0 star rating

"It is a travesty that I have just discovered Which Wich this week. I mean, I knew it existed, but I just assumed it was like Subway or Quiznos. If I had known...well, I'd have been eating there more, that's for sure. In 4 days, I've been there twice. Now that I'm bored with cooking, I can see this being my go to for a meal.I love that I mark up my bag with exactly what I want and I don't have to sit there and list it all and hope they remember or watch them make it and point to all the stuff I want. Plus, I love a Sharpie.Also, olive mix? God bless you Which Wich. Deli chicken? I LOVE deli chicken! The toppings and the cheese choices are perfect. I can create masterpieces at Which Wich!The icing on the cake (or mustard on the sandwich?) is that the bread is so perfectly toasted. It's just crunchy enough on the outside, and nice and soft on the inside. Seriously, this is my perfect sandwich. I'm going again for dinner.",5.0 star rating
"Great subs, but service could have been improved.My boss had a number of out of state employees in town for a yearly meeting. Since they were basically in meetings all day, lunch would often be take out.Well, in one particular instance, I had faxed in orders for 13 different sub orders for pick up. After I had faxed everything in, I tried calling for confirmation, but their answering machine just said they were busy and to call back later. It was before the lunch hour rush so it couldn't have been that busy, but even after calling a few more times, I still had no luck getting through.When I came in to pick up, the manager had no idea what I was talking about. Then, come to find out, their fax machine had ran out of paper so once that was fixed, THEN my order was coming through. It was getting busy, but even while trying to put a priority on my order, it STILL took 40 minutes!But, everyone was satisfied with their subs...especially since they have Cheez Whiz as a condiment.Later that week, everyone wanted Which Wich again. I faxed the orders again and luckily was able to get through on the phones this time around to avoid this mishap!",3.0 star rating
"This is a mighty faine place for a quick sandwich.  If it matters to you, its a franchise.  The line can be long at peak times (lunchtime during the week but it moves pretty quickly.Do yourself a favor and put your initials in huge letters on the back of the bag and you can see exactly when your sandy gets made.",3.0 star rating

"Which Wich has a far superior quick sandwich than any other store in town. The reasons why are:1)the variety, especially for vegetarians is uncomparable. Without having meat I have probably a dozen choices. 2)They toast the bread 3) There are a lot of, some unique, ingredients to pick from, especially compared to other sandwich places.4)The ordering system is awesome! You don't have to hmm and haa over each ingredient while walking down sub-row with the sandwich maker. You can do all that before you drop off your bag so that they can just get it done and get you eating. 5)It's the cheapest place to get a reliable meal downtown. Every sandwich is the same price. You might say ""but if you're getting a vegetarian sandwich, don't you think you should pay less?"". And I would answer ""it's $4.75, I'm not complaining"". Ok, so I choose to review the Which Wich downtown, so to be fair I'll tell you the ratings I would give a couple of the others since I've been to them and they're not all the same:Mueller: 3stars---usually only 2 people working and it takes forever to get a sandwich if more than one person is in the shop with you.Triangle: 3stars---for some reason it seems like their oven is turned on too high because every sandwich I get from there seems extremely crunchy...and not the good crunch like the Which Wich downtown, but like burnt crunch.The Drag: 5stars---similar to downtown. delicious!",5.0 star rating

"That's funny.  The previous reviewer's main point is that he hates the ordering system.  I love it.  It allows me to quickly and easily write down what I want so I don't have to follow the sandwich down the line explaining to the sandwich maker what to put on and what to leave off.  Just mark on the bag the things you want, add your name, and wait for the sandwich.  I also like their pricing--all sandwiches are the same price, $4.75.  Which Wich has come up with a simple and seamless way to order and pay for your sandwich.  The surprise is that the sandwiches are excellent.One thing about this location, though...during busy times, the placement of the ordering counter does lead to a constant bottleneck of people waiting to get to the ordering counter to fill out their order.  And some people don't wait their turn, they reach past people who are filling out their bags, quickly fill out their own bag, and skip the line.  I'm not saying it's cheating, because some people are indecisive and may take a long time reading over the extensive list of ingredients, and if  you've got a 30 minute lunch, maybe you need to rush...but it does lead to some awkwardness, with some people obviously wanting to jump the line but holding back because they are unsure of the proper etiquette, while some others just go for it.",5.0 star rating
"I went to Which Wich today for lunch because I was jonesing for one of their oreo cookie malts. (I walked around a little downtown first because it made me feel better about getting the malt.) I felt a little more like a pro this time on my second go-round. Walking up and grabbing the bag with confidence, making solid marks on the bag without scribbling something out and knowing to put my name on it. :) They have a lot of choices of sandwiches. They have about 5-6 varieties of sandwiches, depending on what meat you choose. Two choices of bread.  I get the wheat.  Then, you get to pick from a ton of toppings. They do charge you extra for some, but it is clearly marked on the bag, but there seem to be things they don't charge for other places do. (Like banana peppers JJ's!) The transaction was smooth and the wait time was minimal. While waiting, I checked out the place. The items at the drink station seemed to be well stocked and the dining area was fairly clean. They also have seating outside. The people behind the counter are pleasant. The sandwiches and malts are really good. My sandwich was warm......mmmmmmmmm! The reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of the 5 I know this place could have because of the following: 1)The cup my malt came in was not even full! There was almost an inch of air. I saw the manager trying to squeeze out every last bit from the blending cup to fill it up, but just couldn't do it. Instead of blending a little more for me, he just gave me a partially empty cup. 2)The malt I ordered was full of half blended cookies I ended up eating with a spoon when all the ice cream was sucked up my straw 3)They charge $1.10 for a tiny bag of chips---really??",3.0 star rating
"Which Wich.....Your sandwiches taste so much better than any other sandwich joint. But your portions have gotten smaller and your prices are high. I prefer the Triangle or campus location. I once went to the Triangle location when the owner was there, and he opened the door for us, was really nice, and even took our picture while we posed with our sandwiches. Haha!The downtown location has screwed up my order more than once, all while taking forever and a day.  They also told me they delivered, but forgot to mention only if it's 10 or more sandwiches...so that sucks. They also ended the buy 10 get 1 free deal before I could get my free one! I love all the options though, and pimping out a bag to hang on the wall.",5.0 star rating

There's just no flavor behind any of the dishes. Which is a real disappointment, because I just end up feeling like I wasted money every time I visit.I probably won't make an effort to come back for dinner, as there are plenty of other options within a few blocks that I enjoy much better, but considering I have some friends that really enjoy the brunch menu, I might still give that a shot.",2.0 star rating

"I had heard so many good things about this place so I came in with high expectations. First the valet parking is a joke- there are only about 5 spots and once they fill up, they won't valet any more cars. The food was mediocre at best- the waiter keeps pressuring you to get guac and salsa. We got the traditional guac which was very bland and the four salsas which we never really ordered (the waiter just said to me: you want salsa with your guac right? And then added on the salsas to my order) were just four variations of thin, puréed liquids (no chunks of tomato, peppers or anything). And once we got the guac and salsas, the waiter then disappeared and did not return for a long time.The food in general was served cold/room temperature. We got the cochinita pibil taquitos which were bland and cold. The steak taquitos were tough, cold and covered with melted cheddar that had then congealed hardened because it was cold. I am not sure why people think so highly of this place. Overall service was not good and food was mediocre. I would not go back to this place!",2.0 star rating
"Went on a Wednesday night around 6 PM. Did not have to wait and was seated outside in the shade. Inside was not very busy, but most tables outside were full.

A little more on the expensive side but there were several more moderate options (the taquitos section for example)I got the cauliflower dish -- absolutely love cauliflower so this dish was awesome. Not filling enough for a meal though, went home and was still hungry. Fun gum (chicklets) at the front by the hostess station. Our waiter was great and timely.

"We went on a lark because I was craving sushi on a Saturday evening and was running errands in South Austin. We did a quick Yelp search, saw that the reviews were decent, and decided to throw caution to the wind and check out this unassuming spot on the I35 frontage road.The vibe is a little weird - definitely 90s decor with waitresses who looked like they were working at a nightclub (heavy eye makeup, very short skirts, bare midriffs) more than a sushi joint. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but also wasn't particularly welcoming. She was also nearly inaudible. We had to keep asking her to repeat herself, which made for a few awkward moments. The food was good overall - some high points and some low points. We shared a chicken teriyaki bento box (which was HUGE, btw) and two rolls. The sushi was light years better than the chicken, the standard salad that was swimming in dressing, and the overly salty miso soup. The tempura was also tasty; it managed to remain light and flavorful rather than grease-sodden as some tempuras tend to be at the hands of less experienced fryers. The standout of the meal was definitely the snapper hot roll. I think we might go back to partake in the 1/2 price sushi happy hour because it'll be easier to overlook the ambiance and service if the food is fresh, well-prepared, and cheap, cheap, cheap.",3.0 star rating

Either way, my experience there on Tues night this week was horrible and costly.  The waitress was unhelpful and flippant and didn't know anything about the menu. I ordered the Seafood Udon because she said  ""it's chock full of seafood"" and you get ""tempura on the side like the other Udon soups"".  She was WRONG; the seafood udon had 3 pre-frozen flavorless shrimp, 1 piece of that fake fish cake stuff and 3-4 small pieces of over-cooked tilapia. That is NOT chock full of seafood in my book. When the others on my table got their udon and tempura, I asked where my tempura was... ""oh your's doesn't come with it"" Oh you said it did. ""I though it did""  I wish you would have told me. ""wish I had known"" was all she said as she walked off.  5 mins later she came back to ask me if I wanted tempura... yes please!  When the bill came she charged me for it!!!  REALLY??  Anyway, the combo of mediocre food, bad service and a waitress with attitude ensures I'll never recommend Umi again and will likely not eat there again either.",1.0 star rating
"The happy hour menu looked good but I ordered off the regular menu. The Jalamaci was soooo yummy...Japanese yellowtail sashimi topped w/ tobiko and chopped jalepenos in ponzu sauce. I also had the Hamachi Kama yellowtail collar grilled w/ sea salt and yuzu. Enjoyed a nice Sauv Blanc and I was a happy camper. Definitely recommend this place, about 15 minutes south of downtown. Nice atmosphere, I sat at the bar (they have a full bar) and my server, Gwen was very sweet and attentive. The dining area had low lights and a nice ambiance. The only thing I didn't like about this place is that all the female servers were dressed provocatively which is not necessary when you have great food.",4.0 star rating

"One of My Late Night Favorites!!I loooooovvveee the reverse happy hour. Thursday-Saturday from 9p-11p! You will catch me here quite  often!! I even have my own personal favorite server, (Tiffany)!I indulge in $1.50 Sake bombs, $5.00 Pineapple Sake and $4.00 Mexican Martinis, Longhorn Rolls, Eel Rolls, Edamame, Fried Wings, Hot Wings, and the list goes on and on!! They often have other drink specials or speciality rolls with cutesy names for the night. I just named some of my favorites!!The ambiance is also pretty cool and laid back! Very versatile crowd with a DJ spinning house music. He will even take request.I have definitely earled my frequent roller miles, sushi roll that is ! :)",5.0 star rating
"My husband and I are die-hard Umi fans. We discovered this atmospheric hide-away our first year in Austin and have been returning ever since.

"I have been to Umi multiple times since I've moved to Austin, as it is a decently priced sushi place near my house with pretty good food. I went last night, though, and not only was the food pretty good-- it was delicious! I don't know if they have a new chef or what, but the flavor and quality definitely seems to have gone up since the last time I was there.There were two of us dining at Umi last night. We ordered a Rainbow Roll and a Go to Hell Roll- the Rainbow roll tasted very fresh, and the Go to Hell was very good and tasty!We also ordered a squid salad, which is always good, and the Salmon Kama appetizer, which was by far my favorite thing I've ordered. It is simply grilled salmon collar with ponzu sauce to dip-- the salmon was so flavorful and tender and delicious and I want to go back and eat it again today!I would have kept going to Umi had nothing changed (like I said, pretty good sushi, good prices), but if the quality continues as it was last night, it'll be an even more regular spot for me. I would give 5 starts for the food (based on last night's meal), but the service remains only okay, so I'll keep it at 4 for now!",4.0 star rating

"Few things are as enticing with as happy hour twice a day.. especially when sushi and sashimi are part of the deal. Having discovered this I-35 strip mall gem less than a month ago, we've already gone twice! The sushi is fresh and succulent, the ambiance (during dinner and their reverse happy hour at least) is enjoyable (although the DJ does get a little over enthusiastic on the volume side), and the drink specials are competitive with the sushi/sashimi/appetizer bonus... ( I know its redundant but I had to mention the food again in case my first endorsement did not suffice!) In essence, check it out... you might be caught in its spell too!",4.0 star rating
A good place if you are in the mood for Japanese food in southeast Austin. Just be sure the bartender doesn't give you premium liquor when you ask for well. That was a slight problem when we went but the manager did call me back after I complained and told me to ask for him next time I am there. A nice touch.,3.0 star rating

"Cru on Second Street is an amazing combination of cool atmosphere, decor, helpful wine tenders and friendly wait staff.  An added bonus is the really good food.  From cheese plates to fine entres, this place is much more than a wine bar, its a full dining experience.  Add the hip second street vibe and your in for a treat.  I have made it a regular stop.",5.0 star rating
"I want to say the reason I'm giving this place four stars is because of the FABULOUS bartender and his knowledge of the wines served. If it wasn't for the loud person talking on his phone at the end of the bar and the high prices, I would have given this place five stars. My friend had a gift certificate, so we thought we'd check this place out last night. We walked in and the place was barron at 8pm on a Tuesday. The bar tender was very attentive and had an unbelievable amount of knowledge on the wines being served. We ordered a 5 cheese pizza and it came out quick, hot and very flavorful. The bartender did fail to mention the special pizza that they were making that day that was not on the menu. Of course, we would have ordered it. Artichokes, spinach and anchovies.....absolutely!!! We were trying to hold a conversation and there was this ANNOYING man at the end of the bar talking very loudly on his phone. Dude.....don't care what you have to say, take it down a notch. (By the way, he was at Estilo--see my review....haha) Just as aside for you ladies, they have purse hooks under the bar!!! FYI restaurant/bar owners. PUT HOOKS UNDER YOUR BAR!!!! The ladies appreciate it and it will cost you about $20. Go, eat, drink!!!",4.0 star rating
"My 9 year old and I happened upon Crù early in the evening while in Austin for a conference. Inviting staff~ they were genuinely delighted with my daughter's out-to-dinner attitude although they clearly cater to adults. Although they do not have any fancy non alcoholic drinks (our own wine bar has Lavender Soda!) they brought my daughter's 7-Up in a wine glass to make it ""special"" anyway. My wine flight was delicious~ ""My Syrah is Bigger Than Your Shiraz"" and was served all at once. I am used to separate pours but this worked fine too especially as the first needed to open a bit. I would have preferred a better tasting glass~ something bigger for the breathing and swirling ritual fun!The cheese flight was over the top. We combined The Sinful Experience, Humbolt Fog... mmmmm & Parmigiano with a Vermont Cheddar and were served with a generous portion of fig paste and a nugget of honeycomb filled with light, golden honey. Bread, light cracker bread, and sliced apples & pears made this cheese flight a complete meal for us. We found staff to be very attentive and had several different people stop by to check in with us~ I believe it was the chef or owner who came to ask my daughter her favorite part of the cheese flight~ obviously the honeycomb!",5.0 star rating
"It was a surprise find in Downtown on a casual Sunday night. Located right along 2nd st., and its patio and exterior lighting make it easy to find. The interior design was ""classic"". Lights were dim but just bright enough to see everything well, one of the walls was entirely covered by  their wine cellar, and candles in corners and shelves made the bar even more romantic. It was pretty open and spacious, especially with the big, wide windows they had in the front. My friends and I just went for white wine flights (#1,2 and 4), and this whole flight menu was brilliant. Cru's ""flights"" are in another words ""wine tasting prix fixe"" and there are ones for red and others for white. There are about 6 or 7 flights for each wine (if I'm remembering this correctly -- visit their website for specifics), and each flight has 3 different wines. I admit that I am not a wine connoisseur, and I'm pretty new to this whole wine culture. But, I'm pretty picky when it comes to wine, and some of the selections were good. I wouldn't say that they were amazing, but they were delightful. One I really liked was the one from Casablanca Valley in Chile. Cru might not be The place to go for wine (especially since it's not local), but if you are looking for an easy and pretty relaxing place where you can chat with a few friends, (or even a casual date) Cru might be the one.",4.0 star rating
"went to Cru as part of a happy hour. we walked in and there were several empty spots and I commented that we only had 20 minutes before happy hour was over, the nearest waiter gave me a look and said that it wass really only 10 minutes. I told him, you better serve fast then. A different waiter worked our table and was very friendly and informative. the service was nice and I enjoyed the wine flight I had. The fried goat cheese was nice but could have been a little warmer. I do want to go back and have a glass of the Cab Franc on my flight",3.0 star rating
"My girls and I visit Cru maybe once a month and I've been here on a date or two. It's perfect for an intimate date or a group wanting to enjoy some wine and hang out. The staff is friendly, not to mention beautiful. And they always have a smile. Cru has a great outdoor patio to sit and enjoy or you can sit inside, great ambiance and decor. I highly recommend the wine flights. You get 3 wines that compliment each other and they change them up quite often. I normally pick my fav of the 3 and then have a full glass of it. If you are with a group the flights are fun b/c it just double or triples the wines you can sample if you all get different flights. I have only been to Cru to have drinks and sit with my pals. I have seen the food they serve and smelled the food that comes out of the kitchen. It smells WONDERFUL!! I'd love to have dinner there one night, but I have yet to get the chance. If it fits in with the rest of the place I'm sure its a win!",4.0 star rating
"Meh.

"This place has two really great things going for it at brunch time on a Sunday...there isn't a wait and $7 bottomless mimosas. The interior of the place is super cute and the staff super friendly. I did the bottomless mimosas. The food was just ok. The portions look really tiny but only because they are served on giant plates. In reality, they are just about right. However, I ordered a panini that comes with potatoes ($9) and wanted to sub tomato basil soup instead. I was informed that it would be $5 extra to get the soup instead of the potatoes. I was confused since there was a grilled cheese sandwich meal that was served with the soup for only $1 more...Anyway, I just got the potatoes, which were pretty good, and my sandwich was just meh...They forgot to put the honey mustard on that it comes with and then didn't believe me when I told them that it said on the menu that it came with it. They were very accommodating and mixed some up for me. My friend had the steak and eggs and it was good! Although, a bit undercooked, it had great flavor! I may go back sometime, but probably not for brunch. I'd love to try it out for happy hour or dinner sometime.",3.0 star rating

"Some girls from work and I went to Cru the other night for their Restaurant Week menu. First off, it's an adorable restaurant, inside and out. I love all of the greenery and inside, once it started getting dark outside, they put little tea light candles up on the wine shelves....it was the perfect ambiance... our waitress was extremely attentive and very sweet....she explained the menu and then the wine flights to us because most of us hadn't been there before.... I had the pot stickers for a starter and they were yummy deliciousness....my main course was the seafood linguine and the mussels were perfectly cooked and tasty...as was the shrimp. We all had to add salt to our pasta, but other than that, the taste was perfect. For desert I had originally ordered the chocolate chip cookie cake, but ended up switching with a friend who got the strawberry cheesecake (I had a momentary lapse of judgment and forgot I didn't like chocolate that much!)....anyway, they were both very tasty, but the cheesecake was uh-mazing!!! I love it when cheesecake has a very slight hint of lemon in the after taste....it was the perfect blend and the fresh strawberries were sweet as candy! overall a great dinner... I even enjoyed the wine! I had the patio whites....and I'm not a wine drinker....but they were all tasty enough for me to finish and I really enjoyed the chardonnay.",4.0 star rating

"This was my first time at UMI. I bought a groupon for my son and I for $29 . We ordered an extra appetizer and an extra dessert .The food was good , the desserts were great , the service however , just average.  Our server did just enough , filled our drinks but did not refill our  ice, by the end of the dinner I had a glass of half tea and half water no ice. She did only what she had to . She acted as if we were bothering her. That would have been ok except when we got the check 18% gratuity was included and there were only 5 of us at the table. On top of paying the $29 for the groupon the ticket was $35 additionaly and $11 of that was the tip for mediocre service ! I would go back but make sure I dispute the 18% gratuity if the service was mediocre !",3.0 star rating
"Two thumbs down... we live around the corner and grabbed lunch here today. Service was not good, and food was meh at best. The place was nearly vacant at 1:30pm on a Thursday, which says a lot. I ended up getting the udon yaki since there was no non-meat option for the bento box lunch (bummer). It was a large portion, but extremely greasy and maybe 10 vegetables in the whole thing. Just a pile of beige on a plate. My boyfriend got the sushi, which is the only reason for two stars... it was better. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.The atmosphere in here is also really really weird. All the lights were out and it was quite dark. We sat in the middle where the domed ceiling was and when you talk it sounded like echoes. Annoying for sure. Music is generic awful elevator music.",2.0 star rating

Very affordable and leagnthy happy hour. You can easily course your way through the hh menu alone and that's what I did. Sake bombs were $2.75 I believe, hot roll was good, sashimi was fresh, salmon skin roll, brbq tuna nigiri?,tuna wonton tacos were delicious and quail egg skewers were awesome.  They've got a dj on the weekends and stay open til midnight. I had a good time with the service, I think Devon was our bartender.  Umi is very affordable, convenient, with a very chill asian decor. Sure there are better sushi spots up north but Umi ' s gotta be the best one south of 71/290.",4.0 star rating
"Blah. Just... blah.I came here with a date on a Sunday night. Nice ambience, very clean and cozy. Our server was oddly quiet, but she did get the job done, although she never came back to check on us despite it being a slow night.I ordered the Big Easy roll and a Yellowtail and Scallion hand roll (which were served on an unusually large plate). Neither blew me away. The Big Easy was flavorless despite the variety of fish in it, and I couldn't get over how tough the seaweed was. The hand roll was even worse - not only was the seaweed wrapped too thick, it was not fresh and took me several tries to bite through. On top of that, the wasabi had absolutely ZERO kick to it. What's wasabi without a bit of a rush?My date got a chicken teriyaki bento box since he didn't really like sushi, and while he enjoyed it, I saw major improvements that could have been made. Firstly, the edamame was obviously very old; the skin was dry to the touch and they were a slightly off color. The sauce on the chicken was way too sweet, and the gyoza were greasy and tasted frozen. I will say the creme brulee was pretty good. Coulda been crunchier, but for a sushi restaurant I'd give it a 4/5.If this review were based on the food alone, I'd give it one star. But when you factor in the price and ambience, I suppose it could warrant another, though it'd be closer to 1.5 than 2. Won't be coming back unless it's for happy hour.",2.0 star rating

"Came here on a Friday night with the girlfriend. Great place for a date!Atmosphere: Trendy, romantic, upbeat. Service: Our server was Tiffany. She was knowledgeable, efficient, and just a great waitress all around. Food: We ordered 2 piece salmon and 2 piece Hawaiian tuna nigiri, spicy salmon, Philadelphia, the lady bug roll, dragon roll, and hot sake. Tiffany memorized our order almost perfectly, but brought out a crouching tiger roll instead of the dragon roll. When I pointed it out, she immediately took responsibility and comped the crouching tiger and brought the dragon roll. Nigiri - The salmon was fresh but the tuna was a little fishy. Our server said that they fly it from Hawaii non-frozen so I guess that explains the fishiness. Classic rolls - Both of the rolls were great but the spicy salmon wasn't spicy at all. The rice they use is light, and delicious without having much flavor. For ~$6 a roll, it's a steal.Lady bug roll - a spicy snow crab based roll with strawberries. That's right...strawberries. Very unique, never seen strawberries in sushi before. I had to try it...unfortunately it didn't work for me. You can't taste the strawberry and it had a green basil sauce that ruined the flavor. Wiping off the basil sauce made the rolls much better. Crouching tiger roll - tuna, salmon, and escolar based roll. The jalapenos were disgusting, it was only the outside of the pepper and tasted like raw green peppers. Taking the jalapenos out made the rolls taste good.Dragon roll - The same as most other dragon rolls.Gave Umi 4 stars even though the most of the signature rolls were disappointing because the classic rolls were pretty much perfect and great service.",4.0 star rating
"Umi? More like Ewmi! From the moment I walked in, the strip mall decór was extremely distracting and set the tone for this terrible experience. Immediately I was taken aback by the lack of respect given to me from the hostess. She proceeded to walk ne through what could be mistaken for Pier 1 if not for the smell of gasoline hovering in the air. The waitress took her sweet time in leaving her conversation with the hostess to my order, and due to this my thirst was compromised. When the waitress finally decided to grace me with her presence I could tell she truly did not care about my complete culinary experience as she hastily asked what I would be having. Oh no, I didn't want to know the specials and definitely didn't want any recommendations, lets just dive right in! Opening the menu, one word had been dolled out like a bunch of Franklin's: FRIED! That's what everything was. Choosing 2 of their signature rolls I thought I'd be safe. If that's their signature I don't want them signing for my packages pee-yew-mi!! Lathered to the roof in spicy mayo and fried like theres no tomorrow, I couldn't believe what my taste buds was having to endure. Talk about torture! All in all, I'd give the atmosphere a 4 the service a 3 the decorative hand rails a 7 (because there was so many of them ) the ""food"" a 3 making for a grand total of 17.

"I wasnt expecting much when I went here but i was actually surprised. One side of the room had more of a dim lit ambience while the one by the bar had a booth joint feel to it. Overall decor was not impressive. The staff on the other was quite friendlyand attentive. I ordered spicy tuna roll and sashimi bento box. Spicy tuna was actually quite good.  Usually judge my japanese restaurant based on their basic staple of spicy tuna. Umi definitely nailed it. Simply delicious and fresh. The rice could be a lil soft but all in all the taste was superb. The sashimi bento was quite a surprise. It comes with vegetable tempura, 2 panfried dumplings, edamame, california roll, and 6 thick sashimi with 1 shrimp and imitation crab. I didnt get my miso and side salad though. I thought mine comes with it.  However the bento on its own was quite enough. Oh it also comes with a bowl of rice. If youre getting the bento skip the appetizer. Next time I might try their apple pie sake.",3.0 star rating

"I dig this place - it appeals to all the different Michelles that reside within me.  Sandwiches are tasty, and oh-so-cheap ($4 apiece!), which appeals to the frugal Michelle.  Choose the type of sandwich you want from the big menu, grab a corresponding bag, and mark the toppings you want on it - the control freak Michelle loves this process.  And for the foodie Michelle, a wide variety of unusual and delicious choices, including a muffaletta (not that authentic, but still damn yummy), seafood salad, shrimp po boy, pork tenderloin, and even a gyro.  Also highly recommended:  their homemade potato chips, which are deliciously crunchtastic and have some kind of black pepper thing going on that drives my tastebuds wild.  OK, so the dieting Michelle doesn't like those too much, but they're worth upsetting her temporarily.The only drawbacks to this place:  street parking only, which can be challenging; and pretty much no seating for groups larger than four.  But if you can deal with these issues, you can snag yourself a quick, tasty meal that is plenty easy on the pocketbook.----------------------EDIT, 9/23/07:  They have now raised their prices to $4.75/sandwich.  Still pretty cheap, but I liked it better when they were $4.00 (duh).",4.0 star rating
"Which Wich is my current favorite sandwich shop.  Their concept isn't that unique (come on, it's a sandwich shop), but the way they execute it is pretty cool.  Instead of following your sandwich maker around the counter and picking out your meat, cheese, toppings, etc, you get to mark your choices on a paper bag!  it's genius!  and fun!  and you get to play with sharpies (mmmmmm...sharpie smell).  Not only that, but they have some pretty unique sandwich options, not just your run of the mill lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.  My favorites include the olive salad relish and giardiniera.Con:  with so many options, it's easy to go wild.  but i've learned the hard way that just because it is good individually, it does not mean it is ALL good TOGETHER.  And since I'm a toppings lover, I usually do go crazy (I've learned from my mistakes) and end up with a big sloppy sandwich with toppings falling out all over the place.  which is cool.  i just need a fork with my sandwich.Oh, another con:  parking.  have fun.  at least if you go on the weekends or in the evening you can park in the city hall garage.",4.0 star rating
"I had seen this chain sprouting up in Dallas and actively avoided visiting it simply because I'm normally not a big fan of chain restaurants.  So after moving here, the day everyone in the office decided we would all be eating at Which Wich, I wasn't really looking forward to it so much.What a surprise.  Dude, the sandwiches are fucking GREAT.  Can I say that here?  OMG delicious.  Tons of vegetarian options, AND all their nutritional info is offered on the site, too, for the curious.  I have to eat here once a week now.  This place really fills up at lunchtime.  It's difficult to get A table, much less a few tables if you happen to go in with a group.  According to the website, soon you'll be able to order online - I assume it will be similar to the way they handle online orders at Chipotle, which is an infinitely better way to deal with group lunches..  Handy indeed!",5.0 star rating
"I was in need for a sandwhich.  But which sandwich!?!? - Oh, Chris!  Your wit is just so delicious.So I bopped on over to WW and lets tackle the whole situation.  First, clean shop.  Friendly, fun staff.  You've got no problem sitting and enjoying a nice environment.  The experience.  Ok, so...I think it's a little too much like trying to drink from a fire hose.  I mean, you get there and there's a wall of types of sandwiches.  But it's almost daunting to go through them all because then you have all these other choices.  It's reminiscent of ""Back to School"" when the accounting teacher says ""I have only 1 questions....with 27 parts""And don't get me wrong.  That's kind of good when deciding on your sandwich.  I ordered an Italian with double meet, jalepenos, on a white hoagie/hero/sub/wedge and some Italian dressing.  Honestly, the sandwich was good.  It was a lot, the price was right and I left with a full belly.  I'm a fan.  It doesn't get the 5 starts just because it comes across as a bit of a daunting task - which is not exactly what I want when ordering a sandwich.  The brown paper bags with places for you to mark what you want is a nice idea.  Sets them apart.",4.0 star rating
"I know this place is some sort of chain, BUT I CANNOT STOP EATING IT. Maybe its because you could make a different sandwich for every day of the year. Or maybe I'm just a fatty. Either way, I'm going back for more.Ordering here is nice. You check off a bunch of options on a brown bag, hand it to the cashier and wait for your sandwich. You hardly have to talk to anybody....unless your cashier is the dude who will NOT stop trying to up-sell milkshakes. Other people had to have had this experience with that guy, it can't just be me.A word of warning -- stay away from the Chicken Cheese Steak. I should have realized it beforehand, but its made with slices of cold deli chicken. I think all the meat here is deli meat. That is not a cheese steak. This was my bad, I should have known better. I had a coworker punish me, don't worry. Still, don't order it.Oh, and write/draw something on the back of your bag! You can watch it move down the line and won't even have to listen for your name to be called. Some days you need this kind of disconnect.",4.0 star rating
"This is probably my favorite sandwich place in Austin thus far. I like the way you order- just write it down on the sandwich bag.They have a huge selection of sandwiches, and then when you include possible topping combinations its almost infinite.

I enjoy the simple paper bag that has been stamped with their menu, so all you have to do is check off the ingredients you like, which (no pun intended) can be a little overwhelming because there are so many choices.I'm always a sucker for a warm meatball sandwich, but like a turkey sandwich with buffalo sauce.

"I usually love Bar Chi and have raved about it multiple times, but today at lunch may have ruined it for me. I came in at noon with a friend and we ordered our sushi by 12:10 at the absolute latest. It did not come out until 12:50. When it did come out, my food was not right. I told our waitress and she said ""I guess I put it in wrong"" and walks away with the food. 10 minutes pass. It's now 1pm and I have no food and have used up my entire hour lunch break. She finally brings the food and brings our checks. There was no discount for the wait, for the wrong food, and she had charged my friend's order to my card, and my order to her card. She did not apologize for the wait or for taking my order down wrong. We asked her for a to-go box, and did not get it until 5 minutes later. 1:15 and we are finally headed back to work.I wouldn't have written this review had I not had this experience with this same waitress multiple times before.",1.0 star rating
"A good happy hour will stop me in my tracks, bring a smile to my face and start a night out right. We were headed somewhere else for a drink before our movie night when I saw the sign that said Happy Hour. I love sushi and thought it would be a nice place to try. We sat at the bar and I rapidly ordered items off the Happy Hour Menu:*Lychee Martini, so good honestly I have no idea where both of those went?! *Kirin on draft for my guy. *Bacon Wrapped Scallops $4 for 2 Skewers! Delicious, I could eat these all day.*Sushi at only $1.80 per piece, I ordered 4 pieces. *Oyster Shooters, so delicious at $2 each - we had two each, yum! *Sake Bombs, cheap and good. Fun built in sake cups.Everything was really good, especially those BACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS. Damn!  Loved the Oyster Shooters, the tobiko added a different flavor that was unique.

"So sad to leave such a low rating as I had been wanting to dine at this establishment for over a year after reading their outstanding reviews. 1 star for customer service, 5 stars for food (albeit we only were able to enjoy our appetizer). The service provided by the bartender and our waiter were amazing. I wish I could say the same for the overall service provided. My date and I checked in for a table of two. The unfriendly and frazzled hostess completely ignored us and checked in the group of guys behind us first. As a local business owner in the customer service industry, this is a huge no-no. Second, after we waited over the quoted time (which is somewhat understandable given the busy peak time), we inquired about our queue in line. The 2 hostesses dumbfoundedly explained to us that they accidentally seated a party that checked in after us, under our name, first. Really? I think that's unacceptable. And we were only acknowledged because we went to ask about our position in line. We ordered food immediately once we were seated (so we could attend a show for which we had tickets). The couple that sat down after us was served before us and our ordered food took longer than expected to arrive. We couldn't afford to wait any longer for our entrées so we unfortunately had to cancel our order. Apparently the 2-2.5 hours that we allotted for dinner was not enough given the poor coordination of the hostesses. I'd recommend that management retrain the hostesses for proper etiquette, basic customer service skills and time management skills (traits that are a no-brainer for a hostess position), especially given the fact that the hostesses are the first point of contact for customers and set the tone for the dining experience. Maybe also consider hiring more staff to accommodate patrons during peak times. Otherwise, please do not promise unrealistic times. Had we been given a more accurate time line, we wouldn't have wasted our time to leave empty-stomached and would've been more than happy to visit at another not-so-busy time.",1.0 star rating

"I used to come here all the time for their Happy Hour menu! I've also ordered from their regular menu (which is great as well). The only reason I haven't been lately is because it's gotten so popular that it's always overpacked. I always order their salmon nigiri, tofu, calamari, oyster shooter, and bloody sake mary. Pretty much anything on the happy hour menu is good (although I don't go for the sushi just because I'm a nigiri/sashimi person, not a fan of sushi in general). They have great customer service and the owners are very nice (my friend's family friends). I just wish they could expand their venue, or even open another one! Parking downtown also sucks but what's new. This is definitely one of my favorite places in Austin for HH and to down some sake bombs with friends.",4.0 star rating
"I've been to Umi a few times over the years.  Every time, the sushi was pretty decent, but the overall experience was lacking for one reason or another.  In the distant past, it was service issues, but on my latest visit, we showed up on a night where they had a DJ playing.  He was spinning 80s/90s R&B (weird?), and unfortunately we were seated about ten feet away from him and his speakers.  The waitress accommodated us when we requested to be moved to another table, but the restaurant was still pretty loud.  My date and I had hoped to be eating at a place where we could carry on a conversation.  Foiled again!As far as the sushi goes, the ""Go to Hell"" spicy roll was pretty good.  The spicy edamame was also delicious.  With far too many other decent sushi restaurants to visit in ATX, I probably won't return, but your mileage may vary, depending on the night you visit and the waitress who's taking care of you.",3.0 star rating
"i love the decor, service, and the food... the spicy garlic edamame is the BEST I've ever had.The prices are just okay. they specials are never that ""special""; so no matter when you go you are spending a pretty typical amount. The specialty rolls are way too much. I used to get rainbow rolls but they are like $14-16 and roughly the same amount of food as the spice tunas. Don't ask for any fish substitutions. $3... and they prob won't tell you that when you order. Yikes. I don't get drinks and even by myself I'm always dropping at least $20-25 for a couple Spicy Tunas and an app. It's a bit high in my experience with other places. but none the less I keep going back; mostly because it's close to where I live. i would def have given 5 stars if they had Wi-Fi. Totally lame they have that ""free"" for 30mins then you pay.  i work from home on my computer a lot and this would be the perfect place to have some lunch and get some work done. They are loosing business not offering free internet like every other place out there. oh and sorry for all the bitching... I really do love this place about 8 out of 10 but the DJ is totally annoying and always too loud when there. maybe I'm a minority in saying this but it always makes me wanna leave. I'm a musician who loves hip-hop and Bonobo and organic trance music but these guys... ehhh... straight garage band beats with no personality.So Umi, if you are reading this.... Please. Get internet.

"I never write reviews, but I just had to! The food is so over priced for bad sushi. The service was terrible! It wasn't busy and our waitress would leave and not come back, so it took forever to order. For the first time in my life, I order a dish (the most expensive sushi they had, their ""UMI special"" because I wanted to know what was so special about it) and it was terrible, we literally spit it out into our plates. Not to mention that they do a poor job on the sushi that we did eat because it was a mess, some rolls were half empty and most were falling apart before you could touch them. So we told the waitress, and she went to tell the manager, and she came back and said ""sorry, there is nothing that we can do"". The manager didn't even come out to tell us himself. An order of fries took over 20 minutes to come out, and we were falling asleep just waiting for our food to come out. In the end, our $128 bill stated that there was a $20 tip already applied to our check. EXCUSE ME? What if I don't feel that my service deserved a $20 tip???? Upon calling the manager there (Andre), I stated that I didn't enjoy my food or my service and didn't feel that I should be paying that much, and he didn't make any accommodations or apologies, just asked that I pay the tip.

"I love this place for what it is. It's not a high end place with super high quality pieces of sashimi. To be honest I've never ordered sashimi here; I'll reserve that luxury for a few other places in town. I have ordered pieces of salmon and tuna sushi however and it was pretty decent for the price. But what this place does really well is HAPPY HOUR! They have happy hour so often that you're bound to find time in your schedule to squeeze it in. Great specials on rolls (Longhorn, Hot Roll, Shaggy Dog, Spicy Salmon are all my favorites), great specials on sake and draft beer. Plus, on Friday and Saturday nights they have late night happy hour from 9:30-close. On these nights they have a DJ playing weird techno house music... it's the craziest thing. What is this place? A bar? A sushi restaurant? A nightclub? I don't know but it's just so fun, so cheap!And, above all, it's CONSISTENT. The service is always good too.

"Go in with a Groupon and we're told that we can't use it because it's a national holiday on December 31st.

She confers with the manager and he continues to refuse to honor our Groupon. Manager states that its on their door regarding not honoring vouchers on national holidays, and that additionally we could have checked Facebook. After correcting him again on what the actual federal/national holiday is, we were refused our Groupon service and left. After checking their door, it did clearly state no vouchers honored on national holidays, but clearly it's beyond comprehension for the management to pull out a calendar to clarify what an actual federal/national holiday is.

"Sandwiches are really good! It was a tad expensive for the size of the sandwich but other than that A++. Great variety, many many choices - but I Love the buffalo chicken sandwich! On a side note - who does not love a sub shop that sells sharpies, allows you to do sandwich bag art and display it in the store!!",4.0 star rating
"I LOVE Which Wich sandwiches, but it seems like every time I eat at this particular location, I am disappointed.  I have given it 3 tries over the last 6 months and every time I wonder what the other locations are doing right that these people can't seem to master.  The last time a couple of weeks ago I ate there with a friend and although the only ingredient we had in common was the white bread, both sandwiches were bland and had some kind of off-putting taste.  We actually considered returning them but we were already home...as for the two other occasions I gave it a try, on one I got a skimpy, pathetic, tiny sandwich and on the other a soggy mess that I threw away.  This is the closest location to where I work and it's a shame that it's always sub-par when I eat there.  I hope they can get it right next time I go - I'm gonna give them one more chance.  After that I am giving up.EDIT:  gave it another chance last week after writing that review and consequently craving a Which Wich.  My mistake ordering the olive mix - I didn't know that meant they would slather an ENTIRE tablespoon of oil on my sandwich.   It soaked clear through the wax paper and all over the table.  I almost took a picture.  Yes, it was that bad.  And it was unevenly toasted.  One half had melted cheese, the other was cold...?  I got a chocolate chip cookie that was inedible except for the middle, like it had been overcooked to begin with and then they threw it in the toaster in the hopes of tricking me into thinking that it was ""fresh"".  The Sunset Valley location always has delicious cookies, so what gives?  And after reading other reviews, I must agree, service is always borderline rude, which is probably why I never return anything.  I am only posting this in the hopes that the owner and/or manager will get this place up to the level of other locations.  I don't want to drive to campus or Sunset Valley when I crave a Which Wich,  I work downtown :(",2.0 star rating

"In some ways, I am very much like Joey Tribbiani:  for example, if it weren't for my beloved TV, I wouldn't know where the hell to point all my furniture.  I wear a lot of turtlenecks.  Also, sandwiches are my favorite food.  A sandwich can be trashy or gourmet, healthy or fatty.  Needless to say, Which Wich is a veritable cornucopia of sandwich-related awesomeness.  I love the method of ordering; it allows you to take your time to really craft an excellent sandwich, it's fun (I heart Sharpies) and there's really no chance they'll screw up your order since they look right at it when they make it.  There are so many varieties of sandwiches and so many different ingredients.  I love the spicy mayo.  And I love that you can get avocado on any sandwich.  Plus they have many, many different kinds of potato chips.  And don't even get me started on the pellet ice.  The sandwiches are toasted, which made me suspicious at first because I really don't like overly-toasted bread products, but it was perfect.  Crispy on the outer layer, but chewy inside.  The sandwiches are between a 6 inch and a foot-long, which (with a bag of chips) is like the perfect amount of food to make you full, but not bloated.  The only problem is that I really wanted to get a milkshake, too, but I didn't have room.  I'm going to have to go back when I'm starving.  Basically, the presence of Which Wich brings an obscene amount of joy to my life--I love the food, I love the concept, I love ordering on the paper bags.  Suck on that, Jared Fogle!",5.0 star rating
"I've been going to Umi for years. I love the food, they have great authentic dishes and the quality of their sushi fish is really great. Especially when you compare it to their prices. Really top notch.My ONLY complaint I've EVER had with them is the waitresses. The past 3 or 4 times I've been, there hasn't been enough napkins/chop sticks/soy sauce bowls for the table and it takes at least 10 minutes to flag someone down. Also the waitresses aren't very knowledgeable about the food : (Other than that though GREAT atmosphere and GREAT quality food for a GREAT price.",4.0 star rating
"Umi is our date night go to.  They have amazing prices on sushi and rolls all night long.  They also have a reverse happy hour.  What is that you ask?  It's happy hour prices on drinks when you actually feel like drinking.  I think it's like 7-9 but don't quote me on it. Speaking of drinks, their $5 plumb wine is AWESOME! Watch out because it sneaks up on you.  Charlie, the head sushi guy is awesome! He knows us by name and always makes dinner fun.Food is great, staff is awesome, and it's all reasonably priced. Definitely worth a try.",4.0 star rating
"We were staying at a hotel nearby, and went on a Sunday afternoon, when most sushi places are closed.  This place wasn't only open, they had decent quality sushi (i.e. fresh) and happy-hour prices!While the sushi selection is limited, sushi that they did offer was cheap, nicely cut, and served with a smile. We ordered a bunch of things, and our excellent server got everything exactly right, and kept us posted about when things will be ready.  She did not even take any notes, I am impressed. Wasabi served with sushi is old and plain, but they also offer locally-made wasabi at $3/serving, which is excellent (the wasabi, not the price).  However, it's weird to have to pay extra for condiments.     We ordered fried banana for desert, and it came out beautifully looking, with a big scoop of strawberry ice-cream.",4.0 star rating

"We used to come to Umi a lot, before we had our little girl (now 17 months old). Came a couple of times while I was pregnant (got cooked sushi, of course) but have only been once (for a small group gathering) in the last 17 months. We used to always sit at the bar or in the bar area to eat. The bartenders were always very friendly.We went in yesterday, as we were in the neighborhood, and asked to sit in the bar area (can't sit at the bar anymore, as now we need a high chair). After we were seated, the bartender (female) brought a high chair and suddenly said, ""oh great to see you again."" Keep in mind, we basically haven't been there in a year and a half. The food is good. Not the best in town, but still good. The best value are the bento boxes. It's so much food, I always take some home. You get soup, salad, your box - which is teriyaki beef or chicken or tempura and rice, plus 5-6 pieces of sushi or sashimi, plus 5 pieces california roll, plus 2 dumplings, and edamame. All for $15-19.The bartender and another server helper were super-friendly during our meal and when we were leaving, the bartender said, ""always a pleasure to see you guys."" She honestly remembered us, as we made no mention of the fact that we used to come there all the time.",5.0 star rating

"Checked this place out with a groupon I had purchased and I will definitely being going back again for their happy hour! Food and service was amazing. They have a full bar which is always a plus for me and our server Lina was very helpful with picking out our apps, sushi rolls and our sake. I had read reviews that spoke negatively about the staff there, but they must have fired those employees because our service was exceptional! I recommend the BEEF NEGIMAKI for an appetizer and the Lady Bug roll. I live North Austin so this isn't right around the corner for me, but definitely my new favorite sushi place in Austin. Hope to make it back there this week!",5.0 star rating
The sushi here is fantastic! Especially if your like me and you don't love the raw side of sushi. Great tempura rolls and the Longhorn Roll is the best in town in my opinion. Usually spot on with service and they have a great happy hour. Some of the waitresses their are spot on and others don't know what is in the rolls and aren't as timely.,5.0 star rating
Omg!!! Wonderful!  The food and service was like a breath of fresh air!  The food is absolutely delicious and the servers are friendly always refilling whatever you're drinking and taking dishes out of your way. And not only your server everyone just walks by and if they see something that needs to be moved they move it it's a team effort. The inside is very nice and on a Friday night they had upbeat music playing fairly loud but fine.  They are smiling and just a wonderful night out.,5.0 star rating
"In this part of town, I consider this to be one of the better sushi places to hit.  I guess when it come down to it, it's a lunch spot.  Not a place to go for a nice dinner.  As far as lunch goes, It's always busy, but never over crowded.  Very reasonably priced for good quality sushi.  The owner is always there, and she runs a very tight operation.  She loves getting feedback and takes her business very serious.  Service is very solid.  I have only had the sushi here, and everything I have tried has been very good.  Salmon, Toro, Unagi, Unago, Hamachi ... You name it.  As far as rolls go, I highly recommend the Tuna Dynasty, the sauce they put on it makes the roll.",4.0 star rating
"It was my birthday dinner and my roommate have chose this place to celebrate.  I didn't really care and I didn't mind either.  I am from Houston and had plans to celebrate my birthday in Austin.  Everyone told me that UMI has very good sushi.  Once I got there with my party, they kindly greeted and seated us.  The waitress was very informative and had good opinions on what to order since it was most of our first time there.  I was told about the Tuna Dynasty.... once I have received and consumed the delish sushi, it was amazing.  Hands down the best!!!!! I would strongly recommend.  Since it was my birthday I also got free dessert on the house.  Our waitress was very attentive, friendly, nice and pretty cute too :)I love this place, would definitely come back!",5.0 star rating
"It was my first time here with my boyfriend for a dinner date. I got a coupon from groupon for a dinner for two that includes 1 appetizer, 2 rolls and 1 dessert. We paid for any additional orders. For the appetizer, we got the beef negimaki. It came with 4 thinly sliced beef rolled with carrots and scallions. It was really delicious and juicy. For the side, we order a chuka salad. It was a good amount for 5 dollars. Then we order the umi special roll, lady bug roll, and another roll which I forgot the name. The umi special roll is riceless so I would recommended if you like raw fish. The lemon basil sauce on the lady bug roll was delicious! Definitely order it if you're a basil fan. The third roll was my favorite! Just wish I could have remember the name! It was on this green color menu that was separate from their main menu. For dessert, we got the banana tempura. By far one of my favorite banana tempura I have had at a sushi place. It came with ice cream too! We picked vanilla ice cream.",5.0 star rating
"When I first moved to Austin, I went to this place. It was really nice andd really good. I stress the word WAS. This was my 5th visit to Umi and it seemed different. They had a friendly DJ, who was spinning some really good tunes. I have to say though, it was really waaaaay too loud. Yeah Andre, I get what you're going for. But it's not  that type of place. The food has become your average ""don't-wanna-drive-too-far-so-I'll-go-over-here"" place. The food isn't bad, but it isn't great either. However,  our appetizer was a joke. I thought it was an accident. Now, when you order calamari, you expect there to a be a decent ratio of tentacles to rings. Everyone here knows the rings are the filet of the squid and the tentacles are the bottom round. I probably had about 8 sets of tentacles and rings equal to about one mature squid.  You might think this is picky but you order it next time and I'm sure you'll notice the obvious lopsided-ness in an order there and an order at, say, Macaroni Grill. So, I very nicely mentioned it to our server who politely said she would mention it to the ""on-duty"" manager. When she returned, she said, ""I'm sorry, I told our manager and he said, 'that's just the way the chef makes it."". Now if that isn't kinda crappy, I don't know what is. She kindly deducted it from our bill. After that, our food came out 40 minutes later. It was ""meh"".  Nothing stood out or popped.  It's your run of the mill sushi joint. Albeit with scantily clad servers. Kinda like a sushi hooters. ""Sh-ooters."" ha!  Our server was really nice, but not intrusive. It sometimes took a little bit of waving her down to get what little extra things we needed. Getting our bill took a little too long. Then we tried to split the bill (In half),  She brought my buddy his half and brought me my bill equaled to the original total. It took another 15 mins to get her to come back and correct it. Since there are other sushi bars opening up around town, I'll hit those up next time.",2.0 star rating
"I'm a tad confused about the ambiance... They played loud Teen angst music coupled with whiny Maroon Five songs and get down and grind it R&B. After a beer I was kind of into it though... They didn't really chat with us at the sushi bar. I really like to sit at the bar to chat with the sushi maker but I felt like he went out of his way to make the stuff on the otherside. Sushi shyness? Sushi making anxiety? Oh well we left stuffed and a little buzzed on my part (do yourself a favor and try the Aashi dark, so good!) The fish was fresh, my unagi was delish, hand roll was not too tight not too loose, creativity not crazy high but it was simple and decent. Probably would have given it 3 stars but since we left so full and they accommodated us for lunch eventhough it was after lunch hours. We felt fat and happy. That's a definite bonus for a $36 total at a sushi restaurant (2 beers, and loads of sushi)",4.0 star rating
"I totally just had the most lovely accidental Valentine's Day date here. We were planning on not doing anything special, but we were both suddenly craving sushi. I don't know exactly how my guy knew about Umi, since it's pretty far south for us, but he said it was his favorite sushi in town, and I can see why.Yelpers rejoice, I have finally found good and reasonably priced sushi in landlocked Austin. With two rolls, a good amount of nigiri (that's the fish on top of rice with no adornments for you sushi novices), three appetizers, two beers, and dessert, the bill for this very filling and high quality dinner for two was just about $60. The rolls we chose were the Yellowtail & Scallion Roll (exactly what it sounds like; simple, tasty, and hard to screw up), and the Big Easy Roll, which was a work of culinary artistry. I almost didn't want to eat it, this thing was so pretty. But I did, and it was amazing, and I want one every day. (It's probably a good thing for my waistline that Umi isn't close to my house.)We were seated at the sushi bar, and our service was terrific. We managed to get in before the big rush of Dates arrived, so we had most of the bar to ourselves and all the time we wanted for our spontaneous four course meal. Even after the place started filling up, nobody hovered or said anything as we contemplated dessert (as if there was anything to contemplate when a tempura banana is an option).This is the only place I have eaten at in Austin in months where I literally cannot think of a single thing to complain about.",5.0 star rating

We use to have a server a long while back was a young man was always friendly and informative suggesting daily specials and took a genuine interest in all the customers experience, the staff could defiantly be more like he was.

"DO NOT GO TO UMI.  I used to really like this restaurant, thought it was a hidden gem for good sushi down south.  Last night, the hubs and I went for a rare date night.The table was filthy and sticky.  It was hot inside and house music was blaring.  The waitress came to the table with COLD SORES and a skirt literally so short that I thought it was a joke.  Her fingernails were FILTHY and it made me nauseous.  My husband's water was full of floating things.  We both felt slightly sick to our stomachs before we had even opened the menus, which were filthy and caked with dirt.  Suffice it to say, we left and will never return.  I don't know what has happened to Umi, but it made me feel unclean to be there for ten minutes.",1.0 star rating
"This place rocks, now on the weekends the club music can be a bit loud when seated in the bar area, however it does add the touch that makes Umi the Umi that we love!  This is a great place, however the change in the mannerisms of the wait staff are a bit unsettling.. Mae, leave well enough alone you will have uptight people that complain and that is not the market that you are catering too. This is a fun loving Austintastious sushi spot that everyone wants to go to due to the waitstaff that loves to have fun and management that ecourages that fun and lively spirit.  Remember you will not please all of the people all of the time but dont forget the regulars that love Umi for what Umi is.  Great food, great fun and great environment for good times!  Dont go changing to try and please them...cause we love you just the way you are!",5.0 star rating
"Came here on a whem and I was totally wrong in my expectations. I was thinking it would be like On A Roll or whatever that is up north. But this place was actually pretty romantic! Low lighting, candles, pretty decor. Color me surprised. My boyfriend thinks I'm prejudice agains strip malls, maybe I am, but this time I'm happy to admit I was wrong. Everything we ordered was divine. My stomach growls just thinking about it. Hot roll, shaggy dog roll, and the BBQ red fish belly (omg!) We also got some tuna and mackerel, everything was great. We happened to order during happy hour, so all that plus five drinks was only $60! I thought we had gotten in a lot worse trouble than that lol It was wonderful, I can't wait to go back!",5.0 star rating
"By far the best place to go for some late night sushi munching. I always sit at the bar because this place gets crazy packed on the weekends. This is always my first spot to hit up when I get off work at 10:00pm and really craving some good food. Their reverse HH is the real draw to this place, plus their funky, club vibe. They have live DJs on the weekend, which can make for a loud dining room, but a bumping pregame. The drinks aren't the best on HH so I tend to stick with the $4 Kirin Lights and then go crazy with the food. Not the biggest fan on the fried spring rolls, but their sushi rolls are pretty delicious, as well as their calamari. I wouldn't bother getting the nigiri because it's not much cheaper than their normal fish and you only get one piece. The biggest downside is that it's in a prime location so if I don't luck out finding a parking spot I tend to just drive home. It's not worth paying $10 in parking. Happy eating!",4.0 star rating
"Never been disappointed at Bar Chi!Food is always on point and presentable. Their staff is prompt and professional. They have pretty decent Happy Hour drinks & rolls.

The chef put soy sauce on my scallops, but the waitress immediately apologized and rectified the situation by bringing me a new one.

"Update: Not a customer centric restaurant. They selectively allow to go orders which is a real pain in the ass for their loyal patrons that live in the same building!!!! Don't bite the hand that feeds you... Right?!? Also, they make sidewalk guests provide a down payment via card on hold because the managers make waiters pay for tables that ditch bills. Shitty management.However! I do actually really like their food and ambiance. Sushi is on happy hour until 1am. Great edm DJ live in house.

"My love for this place is tremendous. The sushi is very affordable and quite amazing. My husband and I did ""Sushi Sunday"" every Sunday for 6 months to try out all of the Austin sushi options. This was our favorite. You just cant beat the price to quality ratio. The reverse happy hour is my favorite, you can get so much sushi and bevs for so little. The only thing that makes me almost want to put 4 stars, is the loud music. Every night around 9ish or so they turn their music up so loud that you cannot hold conversations, not even if you sit outside. On the weekends they get a DJ and the volume goes up even louder. Its just not the atmosphere you want while you eat. Other than that, its really great!",5.0 star rating
"Went on a Saturday night around 9:45PM & it was soooo packed. We went inside to try to get on the waiting list and it took a while because it was incredibly busy. The restaurant is very dark and there was a DJ playing house music. I felt I was at a rave because it was so loud. We got on the list at 10PM and the hostess said we were the next big party in line and we would only have to wait 20-25 minutes. After those 25 minutes passed, we still didn't get seated :( so we wait and wait and everyone was getting antsy. We finally got a table at 11:30!! WTH. Anyways, a bunch of us ordered off the Happy Hour menu (which begins at 10PM). I got the geisha roll, shrimp crunch roll & ceviche tostadas. Being that I got rolls off the happy hour menu, I guess I couldn't expect that much from it? for the 1.5 hour wait, the food wasn't worth it to me. I'm assuming this spot is only good for their happy hour menu/drinks and when you're buzzed, of course the food is gonna taste great haha. Us girls could barely hear each other talk because the house music was insanely loud. We all agreed we wouldn't come back to this restaurant.",2.0 star rating
"We all know BarChi has a banging Happy Hour.  I mostly like it for the food selection, as the happy hour drinks are too sweet or too sake-orientated for me.  Try a Japanese beer or just a regular mixed drink instead.  One thing I know most people don't realize is how great BarChi is for lunch.  In the back, it is dark, cool, and quiet.  When I worked downtown, I would hit up BarChi about once a week.  They have lunch specials that are a good deal too.  I also like BarChi for a late night bite, especially during hectic times, like SXSW: BC is still usually not overrun and you can pop in real quick and get some good food in the midst of all the booze, noise, and junk food.My favorite dishes at BarChi are the Scallop and Bacon skewers, the Adashi Tofu (if you've never had it, it is delicious here), and their Fried Ice Cream (yes).  Their sushi is always fresh and while it is not at the Uchi/Uchiko/Finn & Porter level, it's just below that and at the price (happy hour, lunch, or full-price), it's a great deal.  Four stars!",4.0 star rating

"Average sushi for terrible service. My friend was told he couldn't order alcohol because he was too drunk (totally reasonable call for a restaurant), but when he went to calmly talk to the manager about it, the manager said that not only was he not allowed to order alcohol, but everyone he was with was now not allowed to as well. I understand restaurants being strict about who they serve, but this kind of vindictive move just seems petty.

"Stopped in here on a Friday last minute during the Happy Hour with Brooke A. (friend her please!) she is feeling lonely on Yelp (HA!) Anyways...... she said it has glowing floors inside...  I was sold on that alone.. although our timing was poor since it was a little light outside still and we posted up at the bar facing the windows, but was still able to see dimly lit glowing funness underneath me surrounding the place.The Happy Hour prices are really cheap! sushi about $1.80 a piece -  rolls ranged from about 5-9 each and most apps are in the 4-5 range. Lets not forget the $3.50 TSINGTAO -  that's a good price! Overall the fish is basic, I wouldn't say anything was special... but then again, I was sampling off the HH menu alone. The baby octopus skewer's were the highlight, but they needed to be marinated a little longer I believe. The bartenders were excellent and kept the sake flowing, this 3 star is in no way a reflection of the service, just the overall quality in my opinion. Will definitely return for the HH as it's hard to beat!",3.0 star rating
"BarChi is my hands down favorite sushi place EVER! So about half a year ago I went on this huge sushi kick, like thats all I wanted, all the time and nothing else. While my wallet and my boyfriends wallet both were not too pleased with this, I had the time of my life eating sushi from all over Austin! I've had some pretty terrible sushi, and I've been to the other side of the world and had true and authentic sushi (so you can trust my judgement), BarChi is still with out a question my favorite place ever!I AM OBSESSED with tuna. Spicey tuna, peppered tuna, ahi tuna are my thing like one a week I must consume tuna or not I just melt. Their pepper tuna is spot on and if you are feeling the need to mix it up they have an ahi tuna burger that is so on point! Reverse happy hour is the best thing to ever happen to me and I attend at least every other week. The prices are so beyond reasonable! Their Lychee Martinis are my absolute favorite cocktail ever consumed and they are only 5$ during happy hour! LIKE WHAT?! My only suggestion is they consider a rewards or membership program as some other reviews have mentioned. It seems like a bunch of others are in my same boat and spend the majority of their paychecks here so might as well get a free something, something every now and then!Pros: everything!Cons: finding parking downtown and sometimes there is a longish wait.",5.0 star rating
"Checked this place out on a Sunday, happy hour all day is the best!I really enjoyed the atmosphere, music was great, lighting was just right. Happy hour drinks and food were very fairly priced. We got the ceviche toastadas and tempura wings to start. Toastadas were four chips that were bites each, tasted great. Tempura wings was a winner to me, came with a spicy mayo sauce we enjoyed. Sake bombs are in plastic cups so doesn't have the same effect as normal ones! Finally onto the sushi, I ordered a California roll and shrimp avacado roll, loved both! Plan on coming back here soon. Service was mediocre, I had to call twice to confirm that they validated, which they do at the Amli downtown. When I pulled up at the Amli, parking was closed unless you were a resident.

"I went here with some friends and ordered the sangria pitcher (rosé based) which was the perfect amount of dry with a little sweetness from the fruit. The salsa appetizer was a great app to stave off the hunger and nice and light (4 different types of salsa, 2 spicy and 2 mild). Most of the entree items were a little pricy except for the tacos which were beautiful and the perfect amount of food for a relatively light dinner. I had the steak and was surprised to find the manchango cheese was fried. It wasn't as artful as the other tacos but loved the sharpness of it. The steak was well-done (not my favorite) but it tasted great. My friends got the fish and lamb and our consensus was that the lamb was the best. Service was perfect - our waiter Wes was great and perfectly attentive.",5.0 star rating
"Simply put, this food was overwrought and not very tasty. I feel like they are trying too hard to be special or something, and end up putting one too many ingredients in each menu item. So, it ends up tasting confused and the whole environment comes off as very pretentious.",2.0 star rating
"I'd been hearing good things about this place for awhile. I was finally in the area and gave it a shot. I was pretty disappointed in the service. Our waitress was uninterested, and didn't know what elote or other Spanish words on the menu meant. I feel like when you work at a higher end Mexican restaurant, you should at least know that. Several of our ordered items never came. She said it was because it was busy, although the place was 1/4 full. The food was OK. Didn't really care for what I had, especially for the price we paid",2.0 star rating
The ambiance was nice but a little overpriced for my taste. The salsa trio and elotes were delicious. The tacos were unique and tasty. Would recommend!,4.0 star rating
"This place had nice ambience and the interior decoration was great. It was inviting and the menus were trendy looking. Though all of this was true, the food ended up being lackluster. I felt that almost all the dishes we received need salt and pepper. In addition, though we are partially responsible for the confusion, the waitress repeatedly got out order wrong. One of the people I was with didn't even know what she was eating. She ordered the Huevos Rancheros and coincidentally so did another table and hers did not look anything like the other table's. Overall, I felt the food was overpriced for the amount and taste of food.",2.0 star rating
"I really wanted to like this place based on the location and menu. The restaurant is beautiful. The service is okay. My husband and I took our nephew who was visiting from Switzerland for lunch. We all like good Mexican food. All of the dishes were very small and too expensive. We ordered the Acapulco ceviche as a starter and we each had a bite. We also ordered the huarache con hongos y huitlacoche, poke de atun, and tortilla soup. All of the dishes were too salty and nothing worth the price they charge. We each had an agua fresca. They were tasty. The bill came to be around $90. We won't be going back.",2.0 star rating
"Uh-Oh! According to the reviews, I am enjoying a ""tourist trap"". Hmm, I did first read about this place in Sunset magazine, the same way your Mom first learned of Facebook.Oh well. Might as well dig in. The Condesa margarita is sublime and the food is quite good at happy hour prices.

"I haven't written a yelp review in a while, but I felt compelled to in order to warn others. I went during happy hour and the drinks were great. (Hence the 1 star) My friend got some sort of tobacco infused drink that was great. Drinks are half off, placing most in the 6-6.50 range. Totally worth it for the drinks. The food was a different story. We ordered two tostadas and got smallish tortilla chips. Literally, tortilla chip-sized ""tostadas"". I then ordered a sope that was similarly sized. (And despite having my favorite thing in the world huitlacoche, bland.) The 8 dollar happy hour guac was also too small. The ingredients did not justify the price. What if I went to a restaurant and ordered a burger, and a slider came out? People would lose their damned minds. Is it ok because it's barely passable Mexican food? It's a shame that it is named after one of my favorite neighborhoods in Mexico City, a place I associate with excellent food, drinks, and scenery. Only eat here if you have had some sort of gastric bypass surgery or you are a hamster. (In which case, congrats on learning how to read)",1.0 star rating

"This place is really good, we went for brunch. We got the guacamole sampler and it was by far the best thing there. Their salsas are super flavorful and the guacamole was interesting. BUT as good as the food was this place suffers from an identity crisis. It was super annoying how the menu was mainly in Spanish which made it very difficult to order.... then a lot of the food wasn't even Mexican food! Maybe that was because we were there for brunch. Overall, like most places in Austin, the food was expensive but tasty if you know what to order (or can translate it to English).",3.0 star rating

"We went for new years eve dinner--it was very cold outside and they sat us at a table that caught a cold gust every time the door was opened.  They brought blankets but we ended up having to ask to be moved and they were a bit put out but then said that they had expected people to be cold at the table they put us at?  Hmmm.  They make a big deal of how all the food comes out at different times and I thought that's a bit strange (why not just cook it to where it is ready all together) but then thought that would make the food be hot (which is very important to me).  Well, the food did in fact come out at VERY different times but it was luke warm bordering on cold in several cases.  Food is very spicy and nothing that special although poke was good.  They do charge for chips and salsa--booo.  Our waitress said several rather rude things to us--like complaining that she had to describe the steak dish twice.  I would not recommend this place--there are too many other better places to eat in Austin.",1.0 star rating

"Fun dinner for a group of 8. Lots of good choices to share. Chips and salsa were great as was the hamachi and salmon ceviches. We got the sampler for guac which was ok but too small. Loved the huaraches de Hongos y  huitlacoche(mushroom masa) -great flavor of truffle, corn and mushroom. Really enjoyed their take on chili rellanos -goat cheese and quinoa yum! Loved the fish and the pork shoulder tacos best of all the tacos we tried. The rest were ok or good but those were best. Street corn was recommended but arrived cold so didn't love it.  Drinks - enjoyed the watermelon martini and la condesa margaritas best of the drinks. The spicy marg was good too I hear but small.

I'd definitely recommend they add more raw fish specialty options.",4.0 star rating
"I have been here about 5 times, only once have I received good service! The food is amazing which is why I end up going back after a long period of time, however the service is anything but amazing. I went last night for reverse happy hour, Priscilla was our server, it took over 15 min to get a miso soup after I let her know we had been waiting she stated she was ""swamped"" and would bring it out with our appetizer. I don't see how she was ""swamped"" if it was pretty darn dead and wasn't the only waitress. Once we got the soup and appetizer we waited even longer to get 2 rolls my roll however was sitting at the bar over 5 min before she brought it to me and said the other roll would come out shortly. At this point I'm annoyed and over it asked for the check and she failed to charge the longhorn roll the happy hour price. Hopefully they restaff since this isn't the first time their service sucks!",1.0 star rating
"Let me preface this review by saying, I'm not a sushi person. I'm a burger and pizza and simple food person. But, my husband convinced me to try out Umi last night and I was pleasantly surprised. He's a bit of a sushi aficionado, and had no problems figuring out the menu. I, however, had to ask for help, and I'm glad I did.We were seated at the sushi bar and the man behind the counter was incredibly helpful. He never made me feel like an idiot for having to ask lots of questions. He also forgave me for doubting that the Ika Sansai would be as good as he said. (Even after learning it was fried squid and veggies, I still have to admit it was delicious.) He even hooked us up with an-off menu item that was our favorite of the evening. He called it a Godzilla, but basically it was tempura (fried) shrimp, avocado, and tuna. It was incredible.I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box, and my husband ordered a sampling of sushi. But between the two of us we could have easily fed two or more people, all for around $60. It was not a bad deal, especially in the sushi world, and the atmosphere was low key but nice.If you're new to sushi, looking for knowledgeable but still relatable staff, and great food I'd recommend checking this place out. Just make sure you sit at the sushi bar - the view/entertainment/chat was amazing, and the service was much better than had we sat at a table. (By the way, the sushi fan of the family gave the place a good review too, and unlike me he had upper end sushi places in Dallas for a reference point.)",5.0 star rating
"Best happy hour ever. $1.50 sake bombs! Cheap sake and sushi. I don't even like sushi and I tried 5 rolls with my boyfriend, AND LIKED ALL OF THEM. I am completely addicted to the Longhorn Roll and the tomato bacon skewers. Simply delicious. The second time we went, the service was kinda slow, but food still incredible.

"This was a pleasant surprise.  I had a hankerin' for sushi and popped in on a whim for lunch.  Lunch specials were fairly priced, and mine was delicious.  I had the eight piece sashimi special.  Eight delicious pieces, a salad and a bowl of miso for $11.Here is the breakdown on the sashimi;Albacore Tuna  A+ for taste.  Lightly seared and spiced, with some fried garlic.Flounder A+ for freshness. Almost minimal in taste and texture.Ahi Tuna and Salmon.  Both a solid A.  Just plain fresh and flavorful, with great texture.All of the pieces had a nice cool temperature and were very fresh.  I definitely will come back and try more.  If they keep up this quality I will have to adjust my rating to five stars.  They are so close....",4.0 star rating
"The manager Andre is a very disrespectful human being. One of the waitresses aunts died and was on the phone with her dad crying and he snatched her phone and wouldn't give it back. If this restaurant treats there employees like crap I don't see why I would ever eat here again. The waitress got fired and we spent more than $400 dollars. The chicken plate wasn't on the menu so we asked if they had it. They had it but not on the menu so when I ordered it, my bill came and it was 17 dollars. I kindly asked if we could do something about the price and the waitress said that she could fix it for us and when she came back she said that she took are of it. The manager should have not made the waitress pay for that out her pocket. So the manager came and said that he would take care of her later. To add to the insults he has her come and tell us ""He has another party coming at 9:30pm so basally leave"" The waitress is a college students paying her own bills and education. I think that I've said enough. If this restaurant is going to treat there employees like this I don't want to contribute to there horrible hospitality.",1.0 star rating

"Sushi is a love affair that is still going strong with me so I try to get out and try new places as often as possible. New place: Umi, I dig the name and my friend wanted to have a birthday dinner here. The folks I was with were regulars at this place and know the owner. This is nice, reason #1 they already know what to try and what to skip, #2 the owner gave us a few dishes that weren't on the menu... awesome! I especially liked the Japanese ceviche, it was spicy with citrus and the shrimp and fish were delish. The Austin roll was yummy, as well as the Caterpillar roll were among my favs. The service was excellent, our waiter was knowledgeable about all of the dishes including the sake and gave us suggestions. The decor is kind of the typical sushi restaurant style but it is very clean and the tables are big. The owner is awesome, although I am embarrassed I cannot remember her name I am blaming it on the free shots she gave us. Umi is a great sushi place with creative rolls and great service. When you come in, ask if they have anything new that isn't on the menu yet, you will be in for a nice surprise.",4.0 star rating

"I will say that they have recently changed the calamari, which was previously excellent. Now, honestly, it has the flavor and texture of something that just came out of a box. The only reason one appetizer is keeping me from giving them five stars is because three different servers have mentioned that they were already aware of customer's dislike for the ""new"" calamari yet they keep serving it. On the upside it looks like they have also changed the dress code for female wait staff which now seems much classier and as a result they look a lot less like like off-duty strippers. I mean no disrespect to the very polite and helpful staff, I've just always thought they could maybe wear...more clothes.All that said, I've been coming here for years and it is easily my favorite spot when I need more tempura than a sensible person should consume. Try the Austin and Longhorn rolls if you like original spicy rolls and try the Shaggy Dog or anything with Eel regardless of what you like. Don't forget about Happy Hour, you simply won't beat those prices for outstanding sushi and great service.Ariel is outstanding, by the way.

"I went here during lunch time and got the Terriyaki Salmon Bento it consists of well Salmon with a bed of lettuce or was it cabbage underneath, 4 pieces of California rolls with masago on top, 2 gyozas and a cup of edamame. On the side I did my order had a complementary salad and soup. I got this to go and headed to start to work but was very disappointed cause the Salmon was totally raw on the inside. Also even though I told her no miso soup cause I don't really like miso I was given it anyways and someone thought it would be good idea to put that on the very top which if have not figured it out yet will fall cause its heavier than the salad and my meal so it did drip out a bit while i was driving. I called their card they put in advertising it was ladies night and the lady I spoke to was very kind she said I could get a refund or they could make another Salmon.I headed their as soon as I got my break I called in advance and she was able to make me another one while I drove there. It was very yummy and she didn't even question my honesty cause I forgot and took someone elses lunch in a rush I didn't grab my raw salmon to show her.After work I came by again cause I wanted to order other foods and show her the salmon that was raw. I think the manager did want to see though cause he asked her to show him my box.I ended up ordering edamame to go and had the calamari and tempura red bean ice cream dining in. The calamari I am use to have it like a fish stick and crunchy crispy. These looked more like small funnions that were s bit more chewy than crunchy. I did enjoy my red bean ice cream though.The place like many other Japanese restaurants is very dimly lit for some reason. I never understood that part is it suppose to set the mood really for me I just want to enjoy my food and rather be able to see my food in good lighting.I will come back here cause the price is reasonable I got my bento for $13 dollars  and the staff seem to care about their customers I think they just don't know to to communicate themselves well thats all.",4.0 star rating
"This is a great brunch place! With $1 mimosas and bellinis, it's hard not to have a great time brunching. The menu is also incredibly delicious.

"This is my second 2 star review in 2 days , and I don't enjoy the feeling :( I brought my family here for my dad's ""special"" birthday lunch. I did call ahead and make reservations, so we were seated immediately. Our waitress took our drink order , and was very accommodative of my mom's gluten problem , and took her time to explain the menu. I was very impressed with all this. We got the mediterranean pizza , the house salad,focaccia bread (which is just pizza crust) , gluten free vegetable pasta and risotto. The pizza was rather underwhelming. The crust was overdone , it was completely devoid of taste. In contrast, the gluten free pasta was delicious. The salad was very obviously straight out of a box of salad greens with a few slices of cucumbers thrown around. I'm rating the food a 2/5. The food took a while to come out. But the focaccia i ordered for my 3 year old came out real fast , and I am grateful for that. Here comes the worst part though. Our total was $75 , and we paid up with a $100 bill. The waitress came by and asked if we wanted any change. We requested $10 back , considering a 20% tip. The waitress came back after a while and said ""please take back $5, you haven't tipped me enough. I earn $2.30 an hour and deserve a 20% tip."" Unfortunately for her , my husband is something of a math genius, and explained that 20% of 75 was $15, and that we had to get $10 back. It took a while for her to accept that she made a mistake - or, she wanted 30% and lied about a 2.30$ an hour wage - which I found quite disturbing. I'm uncertain about this- is the management paying a lower wage than minimum wage? Or was the waitress untrained to use a calculator? I get that the service industry is unkind to its employees at times. But instances like this ruin everything. With all of this, and the ordinary food - I'd say this is comparable to an Olive Garden. Except that it costs $13.50 for a 12"" pizza. Meh indeed.",2.0 star rating

They are definitely a little on the pricier end, but are totally shareable. My friend and I ended up splitting the bruschetta appetizer (amazing) and the main entree of a risotto al parmigiano con salsa tartufata. We had more than enough, but ended up staying for (according to our lovely waitress) Taverna's sig dessert, the tiramisu. So, so, so good.",4.0 star rating
Had the most perfect date night here on Friday ! We called at 6 and made a reservation for 7pm . When we arrived we were greeted kindly and given the option to sit indoors or out . Honestly the outdoors was cooler with a seated air conditioned  patio. We had  such a sweet and helpful waiter named Cristiana . We started with a couple drinks and the house salad . They have a wonderful selection of wines and beers ( even Classic Italian beers that are hard to find ). For dinner my boyfriend ordered the carbonara ( which I was a bit weary of him to order since we've had homemade real Italian carbonara before ) and I ordered the frutti di Mara ( seafood pasta ). Both entrees were amazing ! My boyfriend said his carbonara was just as good as the ones we've had in Italy ! My pasta was very well made too! Pasta perfectly al dente and not too much sauce or salt . I also love how they supply you with fresh bread ! I always appreciate good bread severed graciously .   To end our meal we had dessert . Our waiter gave us an honest and helpful description of her favorites and recommendations . My boyfriend got the tiramisu with a coffee liqueur  on ice with citrus per her recommendation . He said the combination was splendid ! I chose the vanilla gelato with berries and chocolate . It was so delicious ! I can't wait till I return !,5.0 star rating
"A friend and I decided to try Taverna on 2nd St while staying in Austin for a conference. The atmosphere was lovely on a Monday evening. It was pretty empty, and we were seated promptly. The server was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. We opted for the risotto con burrata and a calzone. The risotto was very good l, and in hindsight, we wished we had ordered two servings of that! Great flavor, comforting creaminess, and just the right amount of brightness from the heirloom tomatoes. The calzone was a pretty good portion size-wise, but not my favorite flavor-wise. I felt it was a little on the salty side. Overall, a good meal and although a little pricey for the serving size, it was average for the location. Conveniently located with a parking garage steps away. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area. After reading all the brunch reviews, I may have to go back for that!",4.0 star rating

"This place was very underwhelming for me. The only reason I gave it so many stars was because it was some of the best service I have ever received. The food, however, was completely overpriced for what we were getting. I paid about $40 for half and entree, one drink, and half an appetizer. I probably would have generously valued my meal at $20. The veal looked sad under a mound of leaking mushrooms and the potatoes were soggy from the veal's sauce.",3.0 star rating

"Great location and atmosphere. Sitting outside today with perfect weather is ideal. Free thin pizza bread is generous and delicious. Two things, ok three things we wish were different:1. Change music from old Beyoncé pop music to Italian pop music. (If you must pop) American music takes away from the authenticity of the place. Avril Lavigne on as I type. 2. Service is ok. We've been here multiple times because we like the atmosphere but each time leave disappointed in the service. That's a management issue. 3.

"I've been to Taverna a total of 3 times.  The first two times was good since all I did was drink the $2 bellinis and had the regular breakfast plate.  Honestly, I was too drunk those 2 times to pay attention to the food.  The third time I realized how expensive the food is in relation to it's size.  The brunch selection was quite disappointing.  I had the chorizo omelets and I wasn't all that impressed.  I don't think I would go back again now that I actually paid attention to the food cause there's way too many better options in Austin.",2.0 star rating

"I'm not familiar with the sushi in Austin, so this may have not been the ideal spot to bring a large party. It's in a great location and seems upscale, and the atmosphere really is nice. . .but the service and the fish both leave quite a bit of, um, room for improvement. We tried just about every house roll from the Austin to the Fahrenheit to the Spicy Girl and they each were pretty blah. I'm not sure if it's the dearth of fresh fish in Central Texas or the sushi chefs themselves, but I wasn't impressed. The sushi/sashimi was equivalently unspectacular. Most alarmingly, our server ""PK"" was the master of the upsell. Every single time he came to the table he tried to take advantage of our group by 'adding on' an item here, an item there, a drink here, a drink there - pretty amateur stuff, especially in a fun/great city. It was to the point where our table literally started shooing him away by the end of the night. Either way, I'm sure there's better sushi in Austin - at least I hope so.Oh yeah, don't bother sakebombing - they have this cup that has a 'sake shot' in the middle and a 'beer ring' on the outside, which literally makes you feel like an idiot. Sake is meant to be bombed, not guided. Ridiculous.",2.0 star rating
"I went here on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. It surpassed my expectations. I started off with the el cubico drink and the guacamole sampler. The drink absolutely blew me away. It sounds like a strange bit of ingredients but was the smoothest, most amazing drink ever! For my meal I had the cubanita-absolutely incredible. From the service to the food to the atmosphere, everything was perfect.",5.0 star rating
"----About the service-----Very friendly staff and great service ! Our server was Tiffany and she was very personable and had great recommendations. She also checked up on us from time to time to see how we were doing. Tip her well ! ----About the food-----We got two appetizers (egg rolls/lettuce wraps and clam sliders.) Both were delicious! The eggrolls are cut in half and you can wrap them in lettuce and dip them into a sour sauce. The red clam slider was also a great one biter. Highly recommended. We got four entrees, clear noodle salad, crawfish, pineapple w/fish and the fried rice. They certainly add a bit of heat to the food so if you can't handle it then ask them to put less spice in there. I enjoyed all their entrees but fair warning - they give you 2 lbs of crawfish so if you're not ready to work for your food and peel everything, then I suggest you get something else. Personally my favorite was the pineapple sauce w/fish. Cheers !",5.0 star rating
"I loved Barchi Sushi and enjoyed their happy hour a lot; however, I got so disappointed and will never visit here again.The server (I know the name but I won't post it here) was the worst server ever since I visited this place. He was not mean, but he did not care about our table at all. He never asked us if everything is okay. When the food came out, he just ""threw"" the dishes on our table without telling us which sushi is which. He never smiled he was never nice to us. After we ate everything, we waited for our check for about 15mins because our server was chatting with the hostess without ever!ever! looking at our table. I think I stared at him for more than 10 minutes but he kept chatting with her.Such an unpleasant experience. I loved this place but that server ruined it.",1.0 star rating
"Can't go wrong with Bar Chi's Sunday Happy Hour! Fun little spot and great atmosphere.... so if you aren't ready for the weekend to be over yet, you should head on over to this place to keep ""Sunday Funday"" going!Went with the following on the Happy Hour menu, and really enjoyed!Austin Roll - $7Chi Roll - only $8Nemo Roll - only $9 Was the perfect amount for two people! Was also pretty good quality as well... not to the level of say Uchi or Kenichi, but we also weren't paying the ridiculous prices from those menus. We also went with a few glasses of their house wine... I mean who turns down $4.50 vino??? Not this girl!",4.0 star rating
"We had high hopes for this place but we were extremely dissapointed. Made a reservation and arrived early, so we decided to get some drinks in the bar/lounge area. The waitress was unprofessional and acted like we were an inconvience. We were called to our table and she demanded we close out our tab first with her... No problem at all, no need to be rude about it. Basically, we had at least 4 different servers throughout our visit. This made for order mess ups and forgotten food. The ""tapas"" were mediocre to say the least, the service was terrible. We will not be returning.",1.0 star rating

"This place is actually 3.5 stars.Pros- service was great. Server was attentive and efficient. Ingredients were also good quality. Ambiance and decor scored points.Cons- value and plating. We ordered the mini pancakes, fried rice, curry and wings. For $10, mini pancakes (or banh khot) would have been better served with accompanying lettuce and herbs, very lacking. Also, should have held back on coconut sauce or put on side, it made dish soggy where it needed the crunch. At any Houston joint, this dish woulda been $6 with veggies galore. For $9, the wings were delish but needed a starch, steamed rice would have been nice. And $14 for the fried rice, either double the portion or half the price. The $14 curry was in the same range (taste wise) as any comparable Thai place for $5 bucks less. Make those changes and I'll be back, until then, not planning on coming back. Yes, I took consideration for prime real estate and great service but you priced it too high.",3.0 star rating
"I had super high expectations because of all the 5 star reviews but ummm...there's a lot of great Thai food in Austin. You shouldn't ever get a 5 Star review unless you're phenomenal! This place was mediocre. We had egg rolls, Vietnamese friend rice with chicken, yellow curry with chicken, and Cajun fried rice. Nothing blew me away.Service was pretty spotty. We weren't asked if we wanted a drink- just given water. That was kinda strange. He was really friendly but didn't check on us much.Ambiance is cool, I like the outdoor area. Bathrooms were kinda dirty and the door didn't lock in my stall, which is weird for a brand new restaurant.I dunno y'all, I'm just disappointed.",3.0 star rating
"Wow, this was a pleasant unexpected surprise in this plaza. I showed up early to the Alamo to get a ticket for a movie, then wandered out in pursuit of dinner to while away the remaining hour. I didn't feel like shelling out $30 for shellfish, so I kept walking down toward the street. Mandala's decor is contemporary and understated, while the staff are friendly and accommodating. I asked for a suggestion between the curry and the pad kee mao, and was very pleased with the latter. It's definitely on the spicier side (just as I like it), and everything was well proportioned. I am always wary about stir-fried sliced chicken, but mine was tender and juicy throughout. Perfection.The owner/chef is very kind and personable, and chatted with me about the influences behind her cuisine. And Sammy, the bartender, was thoughtful about making sure I had a good experience.This was just the pleasant surprise I needed after a long week. Thank you, Mandala! Now that I know there's good Asian food within walking distance of easy parking, I'll be here a lot more often.",5.0 star rating
"What's good is really excellent.But the quality of both the food and the dining experience is highly variable.You can eat like a king.Or you can have a miserable experience.BarChi is a very full menu upscale standard Japanese American restaurant. - that tries to trump the other restaurants in this category with superior quality and some original dishes. Their trump attempts often work. They go a little more Japanese during happy hour with Robata ... but frankly the really good stuff is all on the Japanese-American side. Robata is just a fancy name for grilled skewers of plain stuff ... and it is just as boring in Japan as it is here.This is NOT a place like Musashino where the action is selling really really superior raw fish. Musashino can just provide their merchandise straight because their fish really is that good.Bar Chi sells fish that is no better and no worse than the competition. So their angle is pizzazz and special takes.Ironically - one of their star items is plain simple nori rolls of the Japanese basics.What makes Bar Chi superior on this count?Really really better Nori. The Nori is much much tastier than the black wrapping paper that most other sushi restaurants use. It is full of flavor, has great texture and accentuates the flavor of the contents of the rolls.It is perfectly reasonable here to save your money just buying cheapie cheapie standard sushi rolls and eat well.Wasabi dumplings are a big hit.They have a Chi Tar Tar which is a cutesy mixed raw fish salad in a mayo-like binder. The fish salad is ho hum (mayo covering utterly indifferent ingredients) but the homemade ""nacho"" chips they serve the Chi Tar Tar with are outstanding.Some of the best chips in Austin - that can stand up to any Austin Mexican restaurant's homemade chips and dip.SENSATIONAL fried Tofu. Another easily best in Austin item.However - there is a lot of mediocrity on the menu as well.Mussels in sake sauce are undersalted - (and they need SALT not shoyu). They are messy to eat - and the house does not provide very many places to put the empty shells so they get all over the table after you fill their little bowl. The sauce is interesting. The mussels themselves overcooked and kind of tasteless.Big fancy named sushi rolls are somewhat the same as big fancy named sushi rolls in other restaurants. It is funny how the menus of Japanese restaurants list 38 million custom rolls - how the rolls all taste the same as each other - despite having different ingredients - and how the rolls in restaurant A taste just like the rolls in restaurant B. Fortunately big fancy sushi rolls taste good in most places and they do so here too.Big fancy named platters of ""nouveau"" sushi - are like a lot of other nouveau cuisine. Little microscopic dabs of food. A huge plate (mostly empty) to show off your dabs of food - with a few color swirls of sauce to make you think the plate isn't empty. Totally variable and random quality of the ""mini-masterpieces"".(Often one great, one sort of all right - one boring)The house music is loud and kind of terrible.Service is bad but in unusual ways.The waitstaff takes your orders quickly and efficiently. The food comes promptly. The human beings are nice enough.The problem is table service. Large piles of plates to be used later are dumped on small tables along with the menus - and it is up to the customers to set their own tables and find room for the menus. They also have to store all the future dishes to be used for your meal on your table. Dirty plates are not cleared.So most of the meal the table was cluttered and uncomfortable kind of like eating in a dirty kitchen. This definitely reduced the pleasure of the dining experience.One last observation - this place ain't cheap. If one is paying that much for the upscale downtown experience - one would think that table service would come with it.My fellow diners were less enthusiastic about Bar Chi than I was.I personally thought the high points were sufficiently high - that I am willing to overlook the hit or miss quality of the menu as a whole.Nothing was really bad - and so a mix of spectacular and meh will average out on the side of good.If you are a religious person, pray before you come - and maybe your deity will guide you to the superior items on the menu. Then you will eat very well indeed.",4.0 star rating
"Best sushi I've ever had? No. Best service I've ever had? No. But the lunch specials make up for that! California, philly, and tuna roll for $12 - plus miso soup!

"Came to this place on a friday night for a roomie night! However, should have dressed up somewhat-- we looked like 5 year- olds in the middle of adults, haha. We ordered the shrimp and avocado sushi rolls and the spider rolls. Both rolls were good enough to fill us up and they were so yummy! It was the perfect size of sushi and it was also presented very nicely. The place was dim-lit, but not to where it was dark. Service was kind of slow, but then again, it was a Friday night. The price range was also reasonable-- definitely coming back for seconds to try more of their more ""daring"" dishes that I wouldn't usually try!",5.0 star rating
"Came here for a friday lunch and were able to get a seat immediately. Got the cubanesa, a mexican corn cob, and the dulce de leche. I asked to bring them out when they were ready, so I got dessert first, then corn, then sandwich (why is it a rule that dessert should come last? Am I the only one that prefers dessert first?). The Dulce was magnificent, a bit too sweet for my tastebuds since I'm not a big sweets person, but it was excellent nonetheless. The corn was great. But the sandwich was really mediocre. It was far too oily (usually that's never an issue for me) for a sandwich to be. I'd give the food overall a 3.5 stars,but really the price is what made me round down here. If you can find food (and drinks) for half the price (maybe not the dessert) with equal quality elsewhere, then it's not really worth it. Yep, that was a poorly phrased sentence, but you get the point.",3.0 star rating
"It was Feb 15. We'd had a beautiful stay in the W over Valentines, I cranked out a 5k that morning at the Paramount and I was excited to brunch it up at La Condesa. Chips! Salsa! Margaritas! Ai ai ai! The first thing to know (and you probably do already) is that the place is gorgeous. I'm sure they've got some brainy creative person behind the decor and the design. Funky and stylish and fresh as befits their offerings. (Edit: It's Alison Burke. Everyone hire her immediately.)I asked after brunch specials and our server indicated there weren't any so I ordered a Paloma. What arrived was a a ginger drink in grapefruit clothing. To be fair, the description does indicate ginger. I just wasn't expecting a full on study in ginger. Near the end of the meal, I discovered that there were indeed brunch specials. For one of my $12 ginger palomas, I could have indulged in 6 mimosas. Which I think we can all agree is the minimum you should drink at brunch. Our guacamole was fine, if uninspired. No salsa by the way. That's something you'll need to purchase separately. Though I can go to any mom-and-pop Mexican restaurant and get fresh chips, the hip and oh so cool LC is rockin' El Milagro bag chips. Not ideal but not a deal breaker. That came next. My Carne Asada Y Huevo was so salty that it was almost inedible. I'm a salt person! I love salt! I've been known to carry salt! The folks making my dish should have held back by about half. And while they were at it, tenderized the meat? I spent the majority of the latter half of my meal sawing away at the steak like I'd just hit up the 4.99 steak deal at Golden Corral. His dish? Cold. We determined that it was hot at one point but then after someone poured ice cold salsa on it, it had normalized to a temperature a shade below lukewarm. We asked our server about it (her temperament hovered at about that same temperature) and she was like ""Oh I think it's supposed to be like that."" In two years of dating this guy, I've never seen him decline a dish. He did so. Not just because of the temperature but also because the Huevos Condesa was completely tasteless. He declined to order anything else. ""I don't want to be disappointed again."" Ouch.I'm not sure if our experience was an anomaly. It looks like the reviews run the gamut. After I signed the bill for our $70 brunch, each and every part of which was subpar, we left. Bereft and with that most overused of Yelp phrases ringing in my head: ""I really wanted to like this place.""",2.0 star rating
"As we were passing through from San Antonio to Dallas. What a disappointment from the moment we walked in.  Host took to long to seat having about 20 tables open.  Then our waiter was very inattentive, my girlfriends little boy spilled water and we tried cleaning it up, waiter had a bad attitude. Did not bring us clean napkins and when we asked for a min to review his drink menu, I had to waive him to the table.  10 min have gone by and he still has not brought or offered new linen.  Not child friendly place.  Not a good place for people with toddlers.  Both me and my girlfriend wait tables at a real nice restaurant but news flash to waiter if you are nice to the kid the parents will tip you extra.  Drinks were ok, a bit over rated but drinkable.  Over all I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

"My hubs came through on date night!! Found this gem and it was some of the best Thai food I've had outside Thailand (actually its better than some of the food in the Thailand as well). So the waitress/bartender Tiffany talked us into the pancake appetizer and it was outstanding. Huge flavor with distinct layers. I had the tofu yellow curry which i had described desired heat as ""punch me in the face but don't make me cry"". My husband had the Cajun fried rice bc he's Cajun and cannot resist things with ""Cajun"" in the title. Both of our dishes came out with the PERFECT amount of heat for each of us respectively.

Got the basil fried rice with chicken and yellow curry with chicken. Both were SO good. The basil fried rice is kind of like basil chicken but stir fried instead of server over white rice.

"I don't know why I thought this place was going to be all somber and sedate - on a sultry Sunday at 9pm, BarChi turned out to be Rain with sushi. If there had been a dancing cage in the dining room, I would have jumped in there like nobody's business. Seriously, let's shake those bacon-wrapped scallops. I can tell within ten seconds if I'm going to like some place or not, and right offhand, I think BarChi rocks. Hipsters & families to the left of us, a post-Quinceañera party on the right, and there's simply nothing that puts me in a better mood than being with one of my favorite people surrounded by blaring techno and an all-day Sunday Happy Hour. How can you not like this?Yeah, yeah, the skewered short ribs were a little chewy, the Austin Roll a little mushy, and the salmon, tuna, and yellowtail were pretty much yesterday's news. But our entire bill here was less than our last tip at Uchi, and sometimes - just sometimes - I'm perfectly okay with that. Not everything in Austin needs to be an out-of-body existential experience.What we didn't know was Gabe was across the street getting ready to apologize, and Pikachu only works on Tuesday.

"House margaritas were tasty. Upgrade the tequila and it will be better. Also, I'm a no salt on the rim kind of girl, the bartender put it on the rim anyway and wow, I am glad they messed up! The salt rim has dried cactus and lemongrass with a touch of sugar. I couldn't get enough. So good. The venison tacos should be a daily staple in my diet. Fantastic. The meat was cooked perfectly. House made tortillas were delicious. The chicken mole was not that great. I'm a mole fan and try to taste as many and I can get my hands on. Their's wasn't that flavorful. The chicken was very moist and cooked just right. However, the dish was really just lacking taste. The chips are not even worth eating. So blah and boring.

"Short version: strong drinks, friendly and attentive staff, good Viet fried rice/red curry/crawfish. Convenient area to be in with free and valet parking. You can definitely find better Thai curry and Vietnamese fried rice in Austin for the price range though. Long version:I went on a Friday night with a friend, and we got two orders of the crawfish (total of 4 pounds), which came with two corn, two potatoes, a lot of sausage, and just a few mushrooms. The flavor was ""Viet-Cajun,"" which it mildly was. It was good for Austin, but don't expect an explosion of flavor that you would expect at other Asian Cajun places outside of Austin. We also didn't think it was spicy (it comes standard and you don't specify level of spiciness like other places), but a friendly manager who checked in on us let us know that he usually makes it spicier for himself, and that we can request that next time. Having an affinity for crawfish, and eating it often, I can usually tell when a place does four pounds of pure crawfish and then add-ons vs. four pounds of crawfish and add-ons combined--Mandala's seems to do the latter, which left us hungry still, so we got an order of Vietnamese Fried Rice with chicken and the Red Curry to go. The Vietnamese Fried Rice is reminiscent of my mother's, and the chicken was nice and tender. The red curry, which was supposed to be the spiciest of the curries, wasn't spicy but did taste good otherwise. Our server, Taylor, was extremely attentive and also ran through the drink menu for us verbally (don't think they have a physical drink menu as they're still in their soft opening). We got a couple of their house margaritas, and they definitely didn't skimp on the alcohol.Overall, it was good, and I wouldn't hesitate coming back whenever I'm in the area, especially since they have both crawfish and Asian food under one roof.

"I like Mike!Our waiter yesterday was amazing!  He handled our wily, wonderful, wicked, and wanton women who wine with aplomb and humor.  I've always said the way to my heart is through my funny bone and my liver.  Make me laugh, give me a drink and I'm yours.  Mike's accent that kept slipping between Australian and Oklahoman (raised both places) was endearingly adorable.  But when he easily split the check amongst 12 women and hugged me good bye, that like blossomed into a bit of love.  It can't be easy to wait tables at a sushi place.  Unlike a steakhouse where most folks order the one big meal, at a sushi house most folks order several times a bunch of little plates (expecially the cheap little plates here for HH!), so we had him running back and forth from the table to the bar to the kitchen.  He handled it all with grace.  As for the rest, ditto my last review.  HH rocks here and they handled our large crew very well.  When it becomes legal to multi-marry and I can get me a Brother Husband (you book clubbers will appreciate that joke), I'll invite you all to me and Mike's wedding!",4.0 star rating
GREAT BAR -we usually go here before we end up going downtown. Nice place to start tonight and meet some interesting people. -Every time I come here with my friends I end up meeting someone from out of town-The drinks are on point-And if you have never tried their flavored sake it's a must* trying to get a little wild try the lychee martini.,5.0 star rating

"Beyond delicious.  I love Austin, I love the downtown area, and it was a place I'd not been to.  Why not!?Once we found parking (which was not so great), we were seated at 7pm (outside!) on a Sunday night - but that Sunday was before Memorial Day, so I was impressed.  The service was prompt, she had great recommendations, and wasn't overbearing.We had hamachi ceviche to start, which I would definitely order several of and eat as a meal.  It was incredible.  Dinner was a bit more family style - the hurache, the chile relleno (stuffed with quinoa!), the pescado and conchinita pibil tacos, and the mole.  The portions are small, but it was enough food, and it was scrumptious enough to get the guys to eat quinoa....that's saying something. We tried the spicy paloma and alma blanca for drinks, and we were not disappointed.  Very, very interesting cocktails.  I liked the ginger in the paloma the best, but the alma blanca was a bit more refreshing.Despite visiting Austin several times in the past, I'd never been here, but after this visit, I would definitely go back the next time I'm in the area.",4.0 star rating

The food and drinks I had here were awesome. The service was pretty bad though. The restaurant was not busy when I arrived but I was told by the hostess that they had just had a huge rush. No excuses. I still paid top dollar for my meal. The wait just to take our drink order was at least 20 minutes. Our server also forgot to ever bring out our appetizer. I'll give it another shot at some point just for the fact that the food was so uniquely tasty.,4.0 star rating

"Andre,I'm a bit taken back by your response to my yelp review.  You stated ""it certainly doesn't sound like the feedback we generally get from our guests.""  This surprises me since you seemingly read all of your reviews.  After going back and reviewing them on my own I see a trend with complaints about service (majority about service) and the food.  So how does my comments seem off or inconsistent from previous feedback?  That leads me to believe that you either just write something on yelp to make it look as if management is interested in resolving the problem, or you don't read your reviews (as I stated previously, I think you read your reviews).  Therefore, I'm under the impression you write something on here and don't really take any steps to correct the problem.  I could have written about my bad server experiences as well from my previous visits to your establishment, but I did not.  As far as my comment about some of the rolls being very heavy on rice and lacking in fish.  If you looked at some (not all) of the pictures that people have posted on this website of the rolls I would imagine you would agree with me.  Most people don't want to pay to eat balls of rice with little fish.  It's the other way around.Additionally, how do you address the concern that I can get the same exact roll - say a spicy tuna roll - for $4.50 downtown yet it costs me $7 at your establishment?Do you merely pop on here to save face, or do you genuinely care about your customers?I'm sorry to say that despite your invitation to return, I will not, nor will I be sending any of my friends to the establishment.",2.0 star rating
"This place is awful. If you truly like sushi, find another restaurant.I asked the waitress about a particular roll and she wasn't very sure about how it was made.

"Umi is getting two stars for their service, that's it. The rest of this place was horrible, just awful, I really cannot express how much disdain I feel for this place.Let me expand on their service, our waiter was very accommodating to our 2.5 y.o. daughter which was unexpected and very much appreciated since we were hitting what I like to call ""the meltdown zone dundunduun"". He also added to the two star rating by being patient and aiding in out boat for 3 selections.For everything the waitstaff did the fish and rice made the experience 2 million times worse. Actually, in comparison to an awesome sushi place (see other reviews) Umi was a million ^ million times worse, which I've been informed is one trillion times worse. Yeah, that's right, there is 1,000,000,000,000 times better sushi in ATX, go drive and find it. Don't go here, please, for the love of your wallet and tummy, just steer clear.Fish - fishy, some too warm, some so cold it felt frozen, in fact my teeth started hurting certain cuts were so frigid. Sashimi was too thick, I know this seems like a bitchy complaint but the bite was unmanageable, my mouth didn't have enough space to savor the taste, if there had been any. The rainbow roll was redeemed by the avocado, but the hot roll was just unappetizing in sight, taste, and smell. Rice - meh.We ordered two other entrees to share, Soba noodles with chicken, and Tempura veggies.The tempura was nice, asparagus and broccoli won me over. But oh, jeez, the soba noodles were bland and for $13 way too small. I'm also convinced they weren't soba. Price, way too high.Atmosphere: trendy, inpersonal, large, stripmall-yReally one word: ew.",2.0 star rating

"The first time we went to Umi's was about 5 years ago...so I don't remember much from that experience. However, we just went a few days ago for lunch.The ambiance is ok. If this were the 90's, it would be a posh place, but I feel like they need to update it a little bit.The staff was nice so that's a plus. Let's get to the food:Sushi was pretty bad. For the lunch special we got the salmon and tuna rolls. HEB makes better sushi for $8!!!The rice was not seasoned properly--could not taste any rice vinegar at all. And the fish was just par.We also go an Umi-viche which was their take on a cerviche. It was just a little too sour. The raisins in the bowl did not complement the dish at all. And the tomatoes were strange too. They had salmon and yellowtail in the bowl which were fine. But there were way too many bell peppers--more peppers than there were fish.Ultimately, a very disappointing lunch. $35 for all that were at HEB I could have gotten better quality sushi for under $10.Pretty sad..",2.0 star rating

"I have to admit, I was a little nervous about this place. A strip mall sushi joint? I've had bad experiences in the past.Turns out my apprehensions weren't justified as everything I had - the salad, yakatori, sushi rolls, sashimi and the atmosphere were all decent. Was it Japan quality food? No. But many things aren't, are they? For quick & convenient sushi, this place is definitely on my list.",4.0 star rating
"Umi doesn't take care of its customers properly. The sushi tasted fresh, and was good. But, the waitstaff and management were awful. Our waitress forgot our discount 3 times, after having mentioned it each time that she returned with the receipts. She told us that the manager would attend to us, but he never did even though he walked by. The restaurant wasn't bustling with people so I know they could have spared some time. The waitress even brought us a dirty plate, and rarely checked on us about our meal. She walked by a few times, and said nothing at all. In checking my bank account later to make sure that these transactions were nulled, Umi charged my boyfriend 3 times, twice for the incorrect amount and a third time for the correct amount. I was over charged twice for an incorrect amount and then the correct amount. This was ridiculous, it was a Saturday evening, and it was early so it wasn't super busy, but this whole discount thing was a nightmare. The discount said use only on regular menu items, and we had to hear from the waitress what the manager didn't want to tell us in person, about some contingency that wasn't printed on the coupon. Now, I've been to Umi in the past, and I've always enjoyed the food here. I took my boyfriend here to enjoy the sushi. But, this particular visit was inexcusable. The check and the groupon discount should not cause this much of a problem. They probably shouldn't even offer coupons if they cant process them properly.I am without a doubt, completely and irrevocably disappointed in the service from Umi. I do not know if I will ever return.",1.0 star rating

"This is our sushi place we go every time we get the craving...but the last 2 times have been such a disappointment. But I am tired of spending over $100  and the service is lacking and the rolls I order are falling apart.  We went on March 15th and we had to wait quite a while for drinks. Our waitress didn't do refills, and someone else brought our food to the table. So we saw her twice. Also both of my Rolls were falling apart. The flavors were still good. We went again on March 29th. The waiter was better, but not by much. My food was still falling apart. And I am pretty sure they put the wrong sauce on one of the rolls. We were done eating, he took our plates, our drinks were empty. And we just stared as all the waiters chatted at the hostess desk. We had to get up to ask for our check.

"I'm not sure why I always forget about Umi. Maybe it's the strip-mall-next-to-the-interstate location. I'm not sure. But today when I was posed with the ""where should we go for sushi"" question, I remembered this place. I'm glad I did!I've always had well-prepared, delicious food here (I've come several times for lunch, once for dinner), and the service has been generally decent as well.Today I had iced tea, edamame, and the ""Tuna Dynasty"" hand roll. The tea was good and never empty (thanks to our server), the edamame was nice and crisp (not over-steamed like they do at so many sushi places) and had a hint of lemon on the pods, and the roll was absolutely yummy--basically a spicy tuna roll with salmon, avocado and bonito flakes on the outside. It was spendy for lunch, however (the roll was $14, and the ""black currant iced tea,"" which was really just plain ol' iced tea was $2.50...wha?), which is probably why I conveniently ""forget"" Umi as much as I do. In fact, maybe they should rethink their lunch prices because it was pretty deserted there today...",4.0 star rating
"Well deserved 5 ...  Made a dinner reservation for my husband's b'day and I am glad.. wasn't disappointed at all !I made a reservation through open table and a day before our visit got a call from the restaurant confirming my booking.They have a complimentary valet! Awesome.. Greeted promptly by the hostess and were seated immediately. Our server Scott was excellent. I was glad to know they  had printed a special menu (with my husband's name on it). - making it special always adds that extra charm.I choose a red wine and my husband went with their  forever summer cocktail. The cocktail was excellent.Starting with the Focassia bread - woo can't say much it's a must TRY .. freshly baked with herbs ! Second was the mushroom pot pie - OMG I loved this too .. the sauce was perfect and the pie was perfectly baked with crispy flakes ! Next was the herb roasted carrots which I would say 2/5 !! The carrots were not sweet and I thought could had been a little more roasted .. and it even lacked the herbs flavors.I chose roasted cauliflower and my husband choose salmon for the entree. Which was ok I felt .. could be done better.We ended with the banana dessert with was a stellar. Beautiful presentation and just yummy - and it was complementary for the birthday occasion. Definitely a great place for Date night !The overall restaurant is unique and gorgeous with its own charm. From time to time they have special events going on , and I am excited for their new rooftop which I guess is opening soon ! Wanna come back here for a brunch in ""The study"" as well as a happy hour at the bar .",5.0 star rating
"An upscale restaurant south of the river.They have great service, valet parking, and a quiet environment for dinner conversations. HOWEVER, the prices (figure $100 per person including tip and one drink) are not in line with the quality of food. The presentation is good, but the taste of appetizers, steak, and seafood was just OK and nothing special. You can get a meal like this for near half the price in downtown, and conversely, you can get equivalent service with much better-tasting food for the same price, also in downtown. So if you are looking for a resturant at the $100/person range, your best bet is to skip this place and look downtown. If you've eaten at all the high end downtown places, and want something quieter and off the beaten path, go check out this place.Also this may be a good spot for evening cocktails without food if you don't want to be north of the river.k",4.0 star rating
"I had the BEST experience at Eberly this morning for brunch to celebrate my bridesmaids for a luncheon. Eberly went above and beyond in orchestrating what will be a memorable day for years to come. We had a gorgeous table for 9 women in the atrium with a fantastic, professional, courteous, patient, and gorgeous waitress. I SO wish I caught her name, but alas, I was consumed in carafes of mimosas that were mixed to perfection. Our waitress educated us on how special the space was (the history of the bar, etc.) and even offered a private tour of the restaurant. She was a doll. Our food was very good. I ordered the chicken and waffles, but the eggs Benedict and the flatbread both seemed to be popular choices. Everyone very much enjoyed brunch but the space is really what blows you away and will stay with you once you leave.Eberly is special. I have lived in Austin for 25 years and I can only name you a few spaces as meticulously decorated as Eberly. Whoever put this space together has an eye for both space and the art of food. Places like these have special places in my heart and are the kind of places you want to celebrate events leading up to something as special as a wedding.

"I finally made it to the infamous Eberly!My husband and I came here for New Year's Eve dinner and enjoyed a delicious meal. My one complaint, which isn't even really a complaint, is that we didn't get a glimpse of the gorgeous bar because it was blocked off for their NYE party. However, the main dining room was still gorgeous. Eberly definitely gets 5 stars for decor.DRINKS- I'm pregnant, so just had them make me some random mocktail and it was really good. Finally something without ginger beer!- My husband got an Old Fashioned and said it was awesome.STARTERS- Focaccia - We both really enjoyed this, but I didn't feel like it was really focaccia. It was far crustier, but still really good. I mean you can't go wrong with bread.- Hushpuppies - The hushpuppies themselves were really tasty, but I thought that the crab and lentil sauce that came on top was just fine. Not sure I would order it again but worth a try.MAINS- Filet - Husband ordered this and said it was very good.- Butternut Squash Agnolotti - BLESS. I wish I could eat this every day. The sauce was so creamy and rich and decadent and heavenly, as was the butternut squash inside the agnolotti. My only complaint here was that there wasn't enough... I could have eaten two orders!DESSERT- Banana Pudding - I obviously should have expected this but this is a deconstructed, gourmet banana pudding :) I was skeptical at first, BUT it was really good and I would definitely recommend ordering it. Eberly was fun, but I would only come here if you are willing to throw down some cash, so maybe a birthday, NYE, Valentine's Day, etc. Is the place gorgeous? Absolutely, one of the most beautiful in Austin I'd say. Is the food the best in Austin? Probably not, but it's decent and worth trying out at some point.",3.0 star rating
"I came here for the first time for my birthday and got the Omakase Chef's Tasting (10 course). It cost $206 for two before tax and tip. RIP my wallet. Looking at the menu, the Omakase is a complete RIP OFF. Many of the dishes we were served were on the menu and after looking back at it, it is so much cheaper to order each item separately. I was hoping to get more specialty dishes. Regardless of being ripped off, the food and experience was amazing. I'm a picky eater and some of the dishes I was served were things I would have never ordered on my own. However, I liked almost everything! The dishes were extremely flavorful, unique and very fresh. My favorites were the blue fin tuna sushi rolls, the foie gras (what they're known for), and the coconut mousse desert. My waiter was extremely nice and knowledgeable. He knew everything about each dish and would constantly check up on us. Great service! I would come again for their happy hour. Save your money and DO NOT get the Omakase. It is so expensive and ordering the items on their own is definitely more affordable. I had high expectations for Uchi after reading reviews and from my friends suggestions, but the Omakase was extremely overpriced and disappointing.",2.0 star rating
"Uchi you have stolen my heart.  After moving to Austin I was worried I wouldn't have the fresh sushi options that were once easily at my disposal.  I was clearly wrong. This is by far the best sushi I've ever had!  They offer unique flavor combinations, decadent small tastings and fish that somehow taste so fresh you would think it was just reeled in.  I love that they also offer special dishes daily in addition to they're regular menu items.  You never know what they're going to have available.  My only complaint is that they use to have a lemon gelato dessert with pistachios as one of their stable desserts and removed it from the menu last year.  I beg of you PLEASE BRING IT BACK!  Something so delicious should be shared with the world.",5.0 star rating
"Sooooooo, yeah. I'm going to be the whiner on this page. We came here after it was recommended by a friend and these Yelp reviews. Now, a few caveats - we came to celebrate our anniversary / Valentine's Day / and a few other things, during our trip to Austin. Given the special occasion we decided to do the $208 omakase, expecting to be BLOWN. A. WAY. I thought long about 2 or 3 stars because there were some delicious plates but for that price and a final bill of $300+ for two, every bite should've been absolutely delectable and wanting more. I've had better mouthgasms from omakase that is about 30% cheaper.Standouts: salmon kiwi, tofu, foie gras. The rest some were good, some okay.Service was friendly and nice, and she was trying to stay on top of us but the place was PACKED (Sunday at 8pm!).So, I'm going with 2 stars because it clearly won't affect the popularity or love for this place, but it may help people think about ordering the omakase vs a la charge off the menu. Would I go back and do that? Yes. But I'll need to be back in Austin to do it.",2.0 star rating
"Love this place! If you plan on driving there, you have to valet but it's complimentary. The restaurant itself is very well decorated. We sat in a velvet booth, super comfy. We ordered the snapper crudo, beef tartare, pork chop, and the diver sea scallops. Everything was delicious! The crudo had some citrus flavor but it wasn't overpowering. The avocado, almonds, and radish brought a nice element to the dish. It also had a good amount of snapper. The beef tartare had great flavor. When you took a bite with all elements of the dish, it all came together. The scallops were one of the best I have ever had. It was perfectly cooked. The toasted almond and butter sauce on top worked really well with the scallops. Their pork chop dish is a decent size. There was some glazed crust on the outside and the pork itself was so well cooked and tender. Highly recommend this place. Would def go back for happy hour and or dinner again.",5.0 star rating
"Oh Eberly, why did you have to be such a disappointment? I was excited when my friend decided to have her birthday dinner here because I heard it was one of Austin's ""hot spots""...but boy was it a let down. When you walk into Eberly, you'll be enchanted by the ambience- dim lighting, speakeasy-esque decor, and 2 beautiful bars with beautiful people in expensive clothing surrounding you. But don't be fooled- the food and service is that of a Denny's. Please PLEASE see my photo attached of the $17 ENTREE salad that I ordered. On the menu it was a 'spring salad' with pumpkin seeds, dried figs, goddess dressing, etc And THAT is what I got. To make matters WORSE, they didn't even put dressing on it! I had to send it back for DRESSING. I also had one of the appetizers that was over $14 (I can't remember what it was called) but it was literally raw vegetables, some bagel chips, and pimento cheese, all which I could have gotten at HEB for $3. The cheese wasn't even very good. In addition, our server was inattentive and there were several 20min spans of time when our glasses were empty of water and drinks and he was nowhere in site. And with a party of over 7 girls- it was very frustrating.If you want to spend $17 on some dry lettuce, raw vegetables, and to sit there thirsty- go to Eberly! You're paying through the teeth to be surrounded by tall people in expensive clothing drinking $14 cocktails.

"I came to Eberly for brunch with a group of 10 on a Sunday morning. We had a reservation for 10:30 and were seated immediately and I was a bit surprised that the restaurant never really got crowded for Sunday brunch. The valet parking is a little slow, but since parking is limited there, I guess it's the only way that Eberly can make the space work. Inside, the service at our table was great. As you can tell from the pictures and other reviews, the interior design is what really makes Eberly special. Every room (including the bathroom) in the restaurant is beautiful, but f you can manage, try to get a seat in the green house room with the glass ceiling and walls! For brunch, I had the chorizo hash. I thought that the hash was good, maybe a little greasy, but something that I wouldn't order again if I came back. Other popular items at our table were the fried chicken and waffles and the Eberly breakfast (a basic eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast breakfast plate). I've seen some complaints about the price of dinner v. quality of food here, and I can't speak to dinner prices/quality, but I think the brunch prices are very reasonable for the food + atmosphere. Prices for brunch entrees range from $6-$15, and don't seem any higher than other Austin brunch places.Although the food was nothing terribly special, it was still a solid brunch choice and honestly, I'll come back for the atmosphere alone!",4.0 star rating
I have the feeling everyone wants to love it cause it's the hip place in town and they've spent a lot of money. But honestly I don't think it's that great. Obviously this kind of restaurant tries to deliver an experience and something unique. Imo it disappoints. It's good food but it's far from from the best sushi I've had. I'm aware it's fusion sushi but is tuna with apple really a good combination? I personally wouldn't put those together but that's just my opinion. There was nothing that I would love to eat again. I expected much more. I don't plan on coming back.,3.0 star rating
"Hands down, my most favorite place on earth right now. Start to finish, bliss. We were able to snag a little spot outdoors before our table was ready, I had some rośe, my other two friends had the cold saké. My past experience with sake- just plain disgusto- this cold saké, legit delish. It was like wheat-beer with coconut, I don't care if you think that sounds nasty, because it was hella good. Thanks. Our friend ordered up quite a few appetizers from the social hour menu. Guess what, the saké was $3, sold! All of the appetizers were mouthwatering, my favie was the pork rolls. Try them, go now.The food was incredible, yes, but what blew me away was the service. BEST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD. They were extremely attentive.

I made reservations early on during the time of their Sake Social (happy hour). It was really busy when we arrived and complimentary valet is provided. The seats are cool as there's a slot for the menu. Server was great, but the food took a long time to come out. Portions are small and it's expensive, which was to be expected. Off the sake social menu, I ordered the tuna and salmon nigiri, sakana tempura, and walu walu (oaked-grilled escolar). We also ordered the hot rock (wagyu beef) off the dinner menu. The nigiri was fresh and the fish melts in your mouth. The tempura was light and crispy without masking the fish. The escolar was flaky and the light sauce was perfection. The highlight was the wagyu beef. It came with 6 slices and diners cook it themselves on a hot rock- so cool! I loved the sound of the beef sizzling. I know they plan to open a location in Denver and I definitely plan to visit it when I go. I need to start saving up, so I can try more of their menu!",5.0 star rating
"After reading the scathing review Eberly received recently, I was a mix of anxious and intrigued to try out the newest spot on the scene. I'm glad I went to form my own opinions, because I think the criticism was a bit harsh and there are a lot of great things happening here.First off, the space is breathtaking. Walking through the door feels like you're in an underwater submarine with a steampunk vibe. It's architectural. There's a large atrium for dining, which would be the perfect place to brunch and a historic bar that commands attention. If you're into monumental ambiance, stop here and just go visit. Continuing on the experience train, the service was fantastic. You probably won't have any issues here. The food though, that's the heart of any restaurant and they are missing the mark slightly. The food lacked depth. I had the brunch board, kale salad, and fruit. For a $10 bowl of fruit, I expect a delish melody, but the blackberries were sour and the oranges were too. The brunch board was really great though and a good value for 2 people. Our tab rang up to ~$50 for 2 people, which was in-line with most trendy brunch spots. Dinner seems absurdly expensive, though.I think you should go to Eberly. Check it out and have the experience that they spent so much money curating.",4.0 star rating
"We came with a party of 8 for Sunday brunch around 11:30. There weren't many people, and lots of open seats, but we sat in the main dining area. It filled up quickly, and was pretty full by the time we left. Maybe that's why? But our waiter was really non-existent by the end of our meal and we just sat waiting for him to bring us a check. The decor is so precise and thought-out. I loved the tiling, the velvet booths, the plate and glass selection-- there is an outdoor patio and an atrium. They use books to hold the check/bill. The A/C was turned up very high when we first arrived. I recommend bringing a light layer if you're in tank tops and shorts (as I was). They were accommodating and offered to turn it off for a little, which helped a lot.The food was good but not amazing -- we ordered the brunch board (delicious, highly recommend), biscuits &gravy (but warning, it's only one biscuit per order $6), seafood toast (like smoked trout pate and tartar sauce?), crab & grits (comes w one fried soft shell crab on top of creamy polenta-like grits). I definitely recommend the grits! I also got an Everly Bloody, and I really liked it! It was salty, savory, and went really well with the dishes I ate.Other people in our party got avocado toast, and they said it had no flavor and was quite bland. Another person had chicken & waffles and said the chicken was perfectly moist. The bathrooms are communal and gender neutral, so men and women use individual stalls within the same bathroom (it's a door labeled ""restrooms""). The bigger stalls have urinals.",4.0 star rating
"Get the avocado toast!!!! *end of review*Lol ok I'll go on.This place is a nice little gem- free valet, very pretty interior, super nice staff. It was perfect for Mother's Day brunch!A little pricey- but that's to be expected?The Eberly Breakfast was yummy, but the potato cake was pretty dry. I liked the unique twist on the usual hash browns though. The hot cakes were really rich and delicious. The biscuit was great but the gravy was just ok. The avocado toast was the only thing that blew us away.",4.0 star rating
"We had dinner here for the first time for our a anniversary. Our server Felix was very wonderful and explained the menu to us. We ended up ordering the Omakase - 6 course signature tasting along with a couple happy hour specials and a fried rice clay pot dish off the menu. We didn't think it be enough food but it definitely was! Everything was wonderful and tasted exquisite. Our server even brought out complimentary Brussels sprouts for us which were the best I've ever had! Overall, atmosphere, customer service and food was awesome!",5.0 star rating
"First off, I've always been picky with sushi but from be first time I came here I quickly learned that the right sushi place can definitely make a difference in how good it tastes. The sushi is fresh and everything I've ever tried here has been amazing. I went the first time for their happy hour, which is worth it since plates are cheaper. The second time I went for a work event and we ordered a variety of plates that were very delicious.Don't miss out and definitely give this place a try, even if you were skeptic like me or if you love sushi.",5.0 star rating
"Drove to Austin from San Antonio- worth the hour drive- Amazing and attentive service, go before (20 min) opening time- hostess will take down name and you'll see people already waiting- more than enough seating outside while waiting and they take drink orders- Their cold and hot dishes are creative yet done properly with respect to Japan's culinary skills. They have another location in Houston and Dallas I believe but this Austin location is the original. My fiancé and I got their omakase and asked the chef to just make whatever he wanted and just surprise us- we only told him the price range we wanted to be at- every dish he created was either on the menu or he would do a twist of something new. After awhile we hit our price range and was really full but we kept going! Loved everything he made but if you're just dining in and want to order off the menu don't leave without eating Kinoko Nabe from their hot tastings- it's sizzling stone bowl with rice, mushrooms, egg yolk popped with gyutoro all mixed and blended right at the table- its to die for!

"Eberly is such a beautiful restaurant!  There's the restaurant on one side, a classic bar on the other side, and a lovely atrium/sunroom in the middle.  Super pretty.My friend tried the fried chicken and waffles and really liked it.  When it comes out, it has a slaw/salad on the top, so it doesn't look like your typical chicken and waffles, but my friend really liked it.I tried the classic Eberly breakfast--toast, eggs, sausage--plus I ordered a biscuit on the side.  The toast was surprisingly really good and salt and peppered.  The biscuit was nice and flaky as well, but I was a little surprised when they charged me $2 for the jam I requested to go with the biscuit.While the service was very nice, it took almost 30 minutes for the food to come out, even though we arrived at the beginning of their brunch.  Otherwise, the food was great.",4.0 star rating
"This place is amazing. The drinks are great! I can get drunk without tasting a bunch of alcohol. Haha. Just kidding -- the drinks here are actually very well made and crafted to perfection!Dane the bartender is the absolute best. He knows so much about drinks and can make you the perfect cocktail for your tastes or recommend you a great wine or beer or anything you desire. Don't forget to tip your bartender!The food is delicious. I loooove the fries and even the little dipping sauce container. It's adorable. The sliders are a perfect amount of food if you're kind of hungry. Or you could order duck fat fries. It comes in a giant bowl... and I mean giant. All of the pizzas are AMAZING. I don't even like crust but their crust is so good. Their brunch is amazing!!! The Texan, The Short Rib Smash are both so so good. They also have oysters that are fresh from different places all over the world. The atmosphere is amazing as well. The place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. Words can't explain. You have to see it for yourself -- especially the cedar bar. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I love everything about this place. I would go here every day if I could.",5.0 star rating
"BAR review--Along with everyone else, I'm enchanted by the beauty that is Eberly.  The Cedar bar space is  warm and appealing, crowned by the magnificent bar, imported from NYC.   Featuring Tiffany glass (the real deal) and comfy chairs, I could probably fall in love sitting at that bar.  And, the very handsome and knowledgeable bartender was friendly.  Always a bonus when you're in a ""fancy"" place.But....  the food is simply not great.  Even though I'm ok with $19 for a dozen oysters (HH Pricing, they're regularly twice that high) I wasn't impressed by the pieces of shell.  And hey, this is Texas.  Why not serve gulf oysters in November?  Come on guys, let's not get snooty.We also tried the house made tavern chips with onion dip--$4.5 for HH pricing was still high for a bunch of fried potato with a small ramekin of dip.  I can't imagine paying $9 for themWe thought the slider pricing magical ($2 for HH), but it was simply disgusting.  I understand it's made with short rib, but did you have to include the cartilage?  I couldn't eat it and would have paid more for actual meat on the bun.  Will I go back?  Well, yes.  Because it's beautiful and I got a decent glass of St Jean Cab for $6, while sitting in a gorgeous space.  And, that bar is just amazing to look at.  And I certainly want to try the redfish, eventhough it seems a bit outlandishly priced at just under $30.  IF you decide to go, HH offers ok deals, but bring a flashlight. It's much too dark in this bar.",3.0 star rating
"This place has some amazing dishes!  The Ocha Zuke is without a doubt one of the best bites I've eaten (Ocean trout, green tea, koshihikari rice).  The price point is a little high, but if you've got $13.50 and only order one item OCHA ZUKE is it!!  I'm posting a picture to check out.Did the six course signature tasting.  Got a huge variety of tastes and preparations. Server correctly said you'll eat a lot but not be stuffed.Servers, by the way, are extremely attentive.  My water glass never dipped below half a glass without someone filling it.",5.0 star rating

"We made reservations for our first wedding anniversary and looked forward to a nice evening together, which sorta happened. We ended up having to scream at each other to be heard because the restaurant is extremely loud. The food tasted pretty good, but most of the portions are very small. The staff was knowledgeable about the menu, but seemed overworked/rushed and annoyed/not very attentive. Towards the end of the meal I had to rush to the bathroom where I became sick. I have food sensitivities, which we made known to the waiter, so sometimes that happens, but when we got home my wife with an iron stomach also became ill. We couldn't figure out what could have made us both sick, since I didn't eat any seafood and all my meats were cooked. Needless to say, it was a disappointing experience that cost us $150 (as my wife joked, ""a lot of money to pay for food we didn't even keep down"").",3.0 star rating
"It was OK. Not super-great service, not super-great food. It was a beautiful building, but the soul of the place left something to be desired.

"Wow! This restaurant kills it in the atmosphere department. I ended up not taking any photos inside because it was one of those places where you're enjoying the vibes so much you don't even think about getting your phone out.We sat at the bar and received great service. I got the ""honey do"" cocktail which was a vodka based drink with  honeydew, cucumber, ginger and a touch of lavender flavors. It was so fresh and light with the perfect mix of flavors.We also got the charcuterie board which was out of this world. We found out the cured meats and pâté are made in house. The cheese is sourced from a local Austin cheese shop, Antonelli's, which I need to visit before I leave apparently. The other app we got was the crab and cornbread which had great flavors but it was on the small size. I would say it serves only one person.Overall great spot and makes a great date night.",5.0 star rating
"I've eaten sushi at a lot of places, but Uchi is the best I've ever had in my LIFE! That's how good this place is. My favorite restaurant in Austin, hands down. Everything is amazing, but my favorite bites of the night were the foie gras and the snow crab with brown butter. The foie gras just melted in your mouth and was unlike any foie gras I ever had. You wouldn't think brown butter would work with crab but it does! I never thought I could get sushi this good in Texas or in life, but I am so happy Uchi exists.Our server Mike was awesome as well. When my little bro went to the restroom as the foie gras was being served, Mike offered to get us another one for free so my brother wouldn't miss out (since it needs to be eaten right away). Just the best service.It is pricey but worth it! Definitely worth the splurge for a special occasion.",5.0 star rating
"WOW! So let me start out by saying how incredibly impressive this restaurant is! If your looking for delicious sushi  and impressing someone then this is THE place! (Expect to spend some coin) They do offer reservations but it's limited we weren't able to get one so it was first come first serve for us. When we arrived it was pretty busy so we had a decent wait for a table! But to our surprise  they have an outside area with some seating where you can order drinks and small apps, which made the wait not so bad! We were finally sat at a little cozy table. Our server was great and knowledgeable and had good recommendations, and the the food was just incredible! The portions are small but man they sure plate up some delicious sushi and wonderful innovative dishes!",5.0 star rating
"I've lived in Austin for 2.5 years now and this was my 1st time going to Uchi. Can you believe it?! I made reservations for their Sake Social with 2 girlfriends and was excited to write a 5 star review.Let me start off by saying the food, drinks, ambience, and happy hour specials were all 5 stars. We got 3 rolls, 3 small plates, and the Brussels. Everything was delicious. What really makes the plates at Uchi are the sauces. They don't put a container of soy on your table, and trust me- you don't need it! We devoured everything and ordered more than we planned.Now the reason for 4/5 stars: our waitress, Jodie, was unwelcoming and sour. To her, we probably seemed like 3 girlfriends getting a happy hour deal and were not worth her full attention because the tabs at the other tables were higher. (Or at least that's the vibe we got!) Her attitude made our experience significantly less enjoyable and also kept us from ordering more food.I will also add in that if you order off the main menu it is a bit pricey. But they have a great happy hour (Sake Social) and daily specials.Overall, I will be back at Uchi simply because the food is phenomenal. I can't wait to try more plates! And I'm hoping that not all of their staff is that way. Would I recommend Uchi? Absolutely!!",4.0 star rating
"Would not recommend wasting your money here. I went here for a happy hour with some co-workers and was very disappointed in the sub-par food and mediocre service. First of all, you HAVE to valet your car here - there is no option to self park. The inside of the venue is very cool - an old-fashion meets modern type decor and lots of space to stand at the bar or sit. However, there are no shades inside and the sun is absolutely blinding in certain parts of the restaurant. We ordered the charcuterie appetizer, brussel sprouts, and a few others plus drinks and it just seemed very store-bought and generic which it should not have been for the price.  The worst part of the experience was the valet. We went on a Wednesday night around 6 and there was only one man working the valet stand. I came outside to get my car back around 7 and there was no line and no one else waiting for their car. He got my car and instead of turning it around and bringing it back to me, went around the building next to Eberly and waited 5 minutes to make a left turn against traffic on South Lamar and then another 3 to turn it back into the driveway. By the time it took him to make these extremely unnecessary turns three other cars had pulled in and were waiting to get their valet tags. Instead of parking my car in the empty lot area, the valet man pulled my car behind the three parked cars and said it should hopefully take him only a few minutes for him to move those cars. I was so frustrated by this and could see the people in front of me getting annoyed too- one couple got so mad they just left their keys on their car and walked into the restaurant without waiting for the valet guy. I could not believe how awful and inefficient the parking situation was and had to dangerously back my car up and turn to avoid waiting another 20 minutes for the guy to move the other cars. Would probably not come back here and I urge you to spend your money elsewhere.",2.0 star rating
"Selected Eberly for Facebook's Women in Design event. The venue (the study and the lounge) were enchanting, the service was excellent, the food was delicious. Everything was on point and the guests left amazed! While the event was going on, the hosts had our own dinner. Majority of the dishes were mouth watering. We started with the charcuterie plate which was exquisite with all the choices of bread and spreads, the tartare which was good but I've had better and the watermelon crab which we think those two should never go together. For entrees, the medium rare steak was flavorful but the frites were dry. The scallops were delicious but only 3 scallops per order so we doubled up. If you're hungry, 3 scallops is not enough. We ordered 3 desserts which were all not bad. I saw thought the desserts offered at the event looked much better.  For drinks, I ordered a vodka sprite and the first one tasted like water; I had my coworkers try and they thought it was water too. I ordered another and it tasted like sprite; again my coworkers tasted and didn't taste any alcohol. I don't know what the deal was but the bartender for event got my drink down right. Eberly is perfect for an event as it offers a mixture of unique surroundings and offers a great selection of amazing food. The excellent service is the cherry on top. Highly recommend!",4.0 star rating
"Few restaurants exemplify Austin's shifting food culture as Uchi does. Uchi has simultaneously offered a break from the typical BBQ and Tex-Mex fare that is usually associated with Texas while signalling that Austin has arrived as one of the bona fide food destinations in the country. Ambiance/Environment/Location: 9.5/10.0     Tucked away on the busy South Lamar Boulevard, Uchi offers a peaceful seclusion seldom found in that area. From the first step away from the valet parking lot onto the bamboo sheltered terrace, one is immediately transported away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The classy interior focuses on gold filigree adorning dark wood. Indeed, dark wood is such a theme that even some dishes are served on it. The atmosphere is unique in a way perhaps exclusive to Austin; one would be out of place in neither a suit nor a T-shirt. Upscale yet informal is the modus operandi of the city, and Uchi does little to stray from this unofficial code in the slightest. Service/Waiting Times: 9.0/10.0     Wait times can be in excess of an hour, but this is to be expected. While most spend the wait time at the bar, some of the more adventurous may walk further up South Lamar to peruse the various shops and restaurants newly opened in the area. The waitstaff is both knowledgeable and accommodating (even to the extent of recommending dishes to a patron who ""didn't eat sushi""). Their extensive knowledge of the menu and laid back attitude assure the perfect dish along with the ideal sake or wine pairing.Food: 9.5/10.0     The signature dish at Uchi is the foie gras sushi. Only Executive Chef Tyson Cole could be so bold as to dream up a perfectly caramelized slice of foie gras in lieu of the traditional slice of raw fish atop the nigiri rice. With a piece of nori serving to secure the dish, it is a perfect example of Cole's idea of merging traditional Japanese fare with modern Western excess. Continue sampling the other sushi remaining or finish with a delicious dessert. Overall Score: 9.3/10.0 Scaled Score: 4.7/5.0",5.0 star rating

"Food:We ordered the French beignet (which was not on our lunch menu as an option) and it was super delicious.  The sugar on top was not too sweet, in fact, it made the pastry so much more savory.  Additionally, we had the risotto con capesante (pan seared scallops artichokes, roasted grape tomatoes, and lemon confit) and it was tasty.  I normally don't like risotto but this was an interesting dish.  The pan seared sea bass was amazing!  The dish contained shrimp, clams, mussels and roasted fennel, tomato broth, and lemon confit.  The seafood was soaked in tomato broth which made it flavorful.For drinks, I tasted the OJ and peach bellini.  Sippin' on the bellini on a Sunday afternoon was very relaxing after a long weekend.  The OJ had a very interesting after taste--almost like it was mixed with something.Service:The service was swift.  Our waiter had helpers that assisted him in presenting our plates and collecting them when we were done.Ambiance:This place was a tad bit too loud because there were just way too many people in the restaurant.  If it was not for the hot weather (Us Californians cannot handle weather pass 80 degrees), I think I would have preferred a table outside.",3.0 star rating
"It may be time for management to start taking a look at some of these reviews. Multiple reviews comment on the bland food, the price not being worth the portions, and the service. It seems like the majority of the four and five star reviews are concentrating on the cheap mimosas and bellini's for brunch, not on lunch or dinner. I came here on a day and I was disappointed. I walked in around 8:30 PM on a Monday after being given a recommendation from a friend. There was no one at the host stand for a couple minutes, but when he came he was very friendly. Probably the only thing I enjoyed about this place to be honest, and he looked like he had been running around, not that he was just not paying attention to the front.The small tables for two barely fit the bread and two entrées, I'm not sure putting a candle in the middle of the mix is such a great idea. I ordered the chicken piccata because the server told me they didn't have any sort of chicken alfredo, no way to make anything like it. The entire plate was very bland, the only thing with any flavor was the chicken itself which only tasted like the capers on top of it. The vegetables included shredded pieces of who knows what and three broccoli stems. Between that, the potatoes, and almost flavorless chicken, I left the restaurant hungry for something with some actual flavor.The server spoke so quietly we had to ask her multiple times what she was saying, and overall she had the same personality as my food. She almost never made eye contact, I don't think she smiled once, and I'm normally a big fan of being able to interact with servers. It feels nice to get their recommendations and see what they enjoy on the menu, etc, but I could barely get two words out of her.The ambience was loud for having less than half of the restaurant seated. It's an open kitchen so do you constantly hear things banging around from multiple cooks. It's not exactly a romantic atmosphere.It also seemed a bit pricey for what you get. The plates are quite small when compared to the majority of Italian restaurants I've been to, and they don't seem to serve a very large array of traditional Italian foods. Honestly, what sort of Italian restaurant doesn't have fettuccine Alfredo or something similar? They did have different sorts of meat, but I would've forgone one of the veal choices for another chicken option.Seriously, the host was probably the only thing that made me smile about this place. I didn't catch his name, but he was friendly and seemed very professional. The server was bland, the food is very bland, it's expensive for what you get, and the ambience is more suited for employees getting together after work than it is for a date.",2.0 star rating
"My only complaint is the waiter. He was awful. Left us sitting there while he chatted at the bar, didn't check on us until we were finished eating. I asked for a Spanish coffee and they obviously didn't know what it was but rather than look it up or ask me for the recipe they just threw something together. My husband asked what was in the Italian Coffee and he said ""I don't know, it's basically an Irish Coffee"". It's on the menu... why don't you know what it is? Usually a server offers to go ask if they don't know. Other than him though, it was a good experience. The place looks very nice; classy atmosphere, good music (Sinatra). The food is AMAZING! Worth the wait. And you can't beat $2 mimosas!!",4.0 star rating
"I decided to try this after seeing the chef on a morning show to promote mother's day brunch.  I did not go for mother's day, I went for a random Saturday.  It was overcast and going to rain, so even though it looked busy, there was no line when I got there.  For my first visit this was good, but I would wait in line next time because it was that good.  And there was so much on the menu and that I saw going to other tables that I want to try now.  I had Eggs Benedict, and it was amazing.  The eggs was perfectly poached, the bacon was not underdone as I have had so many times before, and the hollandaise sauce was so light, it brought out the other flavors instead of smothering them.   We also had New Orleans style Beignets, which was so light and fluffy, and served with a sauce that was so awesome, i would have just drank it if there were not other people there with me.  And at a suggestion we tried the chef's focaccia bread, which was a wonderfully light flavor. What I like most about everything I tried was that I was not so overwhelmed by one thing, everything just blended well together.The service was very friendly, my water was always filled, the food came out quickly.  The table  was kept clean, and I never felt rushed, even as more people started to line up.  I will be back and this is going to be my go to for friends and family visiting from out of town from now on.",5.0 star rating

The one time I went my friend and I had to wait at the bar for over an hour to be seated for brunch- we were told it would only be 40 minutes. We ordered and our food came in under 2 minutes. We both had egg dishes and they were both served cold, obviously pre-made. I had the shrimp omelet, which was boiled shrimp underneath the eggs, not cooked in. My friend had the eggs Benedict. The eggs were not funny and the hollandaise was cold. People keep asking me to come back here but not sure I want to give a second chance.",2.0 star rating
"I've been a fan of the Taverna restaurants and have been to many other ones in different locations and had a great time, but this particular location was less than mediocre. The service was horrible and the food itself was lackluster and cold. I walked in to sit at the high tops and bar area and was waiting for service for over 10 minutes until i decided to get the bartender's attention myself. I believe her name was Courtney with blonde hair... She didnt prepare our order correctly ... twice, and we couldnt even get a glass of water until half way through service ... after we asked her twice. The gentleman next to us at the bar also griped that he had to ask her for certain things multiple times as well. If the bar was busy I would understand but there was 5 people tops there. Our food took forever for an appetizer. Taverna is an average priced restaurant leaning more on the pricier side. I would expect better service and food. not worth it.",1.0 star rating

I went for Sunday brunch and was surprisingly seated right away. The service was great and it didn't take too long to get our meals. The pasta bolognese was flavorful and delicious.

"Located in downtown, i give this place an a+ for both service and ambience but as for the food, I was disappointed. Try three appetizers  which included a bread base, cheese base and meat, none of them were memorable. With the price mark being on the higher side, i would have rather have spent my money down the street at Second bar, where the food actually has some effort put into it. Our food appeared to be prepared by a culinary student on the first day of culinary school and i would say does not represent the Italian cuisine nor give it justice. As severely disappointed as i was with the food, I will give them credit for the service -which was just okay. Will i come again? Nope. The food was not terrible and it was in fact edible.  Personally, if i could do it better then it is easy to say, the food was simply not good",3.0 star rating

Although we had a reservation, our group had to wait a little while to be seated for 14 people because they spent some time putting our table together. As soon as we were seated for dinner we were greeted with loaves of delicious bread and I ordered a red wine sangria which was delicious and a healthy portion. I give a little lee-way with this review because our party was large so it makes sense that our entree orders took a while to make it out. I ordered the eggplant parm and it was delicious - see picture below. Everyone enjoyed their meals.Our server was fantastic - he took care of such a large party, brought out cake for the birthday girl, and was overall one of the best waiters I've had in a while.",4.0 star rating

"My boyfriend and I were staying at the Hyatt and wanted to walk to a nearby restaurant. After searching on Yelp, Taverna seemed like a great option because it was in a convenient downtown location and was pet friendly. The wine we ordered was great and the gnocchi I ordered was even better! Definitely a redo for another date night the next time we're in Austin.",4.0 star rating
"If Taverna didn't offer the best happy hour in DT Austin (try the mussels) I'd still love it. Cozy, gorgeous space, friendly staff, great wine list.  Outstanding food.  And, the prices aren't ridiculous.  Two can dine here without breaking the bank (unlike a S Congress Italian spot ) and they take reservations.Check it out-- try old favorites like lasagne (omg good) as well as interesting risotto dishes and hand made pizzas.",4.0 star rating
"Went on a Saturday for brunch. Ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon.  It tasted ok, and there was barely any salmon. The service was good. I think a better brunch item would be the Polenta & eggs al forno. mimosa was only $2.50",3.0 star rating
"Tarverna is a great spot to grab brunch with $2 mimosas and a pretty extensive menu for that time of day. I had crab benedict that came along some some breakfast potatose that were crisp and hot!  I heard that the complimentary bread was good as well, though I did not have any myself. I am taking off one star only due to promptness of service. It took several minutes to be greeted upon sitting down and drink orders took quite a while as well. I will forgive it and come back because the food was great and the atomosphere was adorable. Would like to try for dinner!",4.0 star rating

"Showed up with a medium-sized group around 5 pm on a weekday to a completely empty Taverna.  We were seated in the dining area, and when we inquired about happy hour, we were told that we could only get those deals in the bar.  As people were still arriving and shuffling around, I asked if we could just buy a drink at the bar while we waited.  No, she says.  You've already been on this side.  Happy hour is for over there.  I said, ""Well, the idea is that we'll stay over there until we finish our drinks, then have a meal later.""  NO, she said.  Like, what, am I BRANDED after having walked on this side of the restaurant first instead of that side?  The entire place was empty!  How about using your grown up brain to make a judgment call rather than mindlessly enforcing rules that, at that moment, were meaningless.  CAVERNOUSLY EMPTY RESTAURANT.Had it been up to me, I would have left.  There are a bazillion restaurants in this city and I don't have time for nonsense.  Don't piss me off because you just can't STAND to give that chintzy ass discount.  They kept our business because it was too much of a pain in the ass to mobilize people to go elsewhere.  The waitress didn't apologize for the silly inconvenience, just kind of stared nervously, like the half-trained 19 year old that she is.  Good job, Taverna.  You're about 209th on my list of places to return to.",2.0 star rating

"This place is good, should you keep your expectations realistic. Come on people, this isn't freakin Uchi.I've eaten here twice and it works for your typical corner run of the mill sushi joint. This place is nothing special, but it works for periodic sushi cravings.Both times my friends and I sat at the sushi bar (mostly so I could watch the sushi chef make what I was about to eat..i am that skeptical), and the guy seemed to know what he was doing, despite several instances of almost slicing his thumb off (come on man, invest in proper knife skills).The fish is not phenomenal, but again, it did not taste fishy or old, so it's okay in my book.I do have higher standards for sushi in this town, such as Sushi Zushi, Imperia, and Uchi..but..they're on a different playing field here. It's like comparing ganache to buttercream frosting. Same thing, different texture. This is what Umi. is. Same thing - different texture.",3.0 star rating
"I went here with my husband one night while I was on my evening break for dinner.  Our waitress was either on drugs or just a complete dumbass.  She asked us for our drink order twice.  We witnessed her almost spill a huge tray of food on the table next to us.  She completely disappeared when it came time for us to pay our check and leave.  Being that this review is more about the service we received, there food isn't bad so hopefully next time we go back that waitress will have been fired : )",3.0 star rating
"The lunchtime offerings at Umi are pretty solid, I have to say. For $11, I scored a ginger salad, bowl of miso soup, six pieces of nigiri, and a California roll. The sushi tasted fresh, and I chatted up the sushi chef a bit as I ate.In the industrial park wasteland that surrounds the part of South Austin I work in, there are very few places to get a decent lunch. Having an option that includes fried food is always a good thing!",4.0 star rating
"I like Umi--though I don't get down there too often. They have good sushi (not Uchi good, but not far off) and it's always a trip because they have Euro-disco playing, so you feel like you are in a nightclub that hasn't quite filled up yet. The service is quick and effiicent, and there's plenty of parking. The spider rolls and salmon skin were good, but the hot roll (not really hot) was fantastic. I highly recommend it (though it's fried, so be aware).A good place if you don't have the time or want to spend big at Uchi. I'd compare this to Maiko downtown, it's pretty similar, though not as happenin' due to the location (but then it's a lot faster because of that too).",3.0 star rating
"SCROMBOID POISONING!  My friend and I ate there 3 weeks ago and ordered the daily special of toro.  It tasted off and we should have know that fish on sale is probably a red flag.  He developed a stomachache and diarrhea followed by hives, welts and severe swelling in his face.  He was diagnosed with scromboid poisoning which developed into an 3 week and ongoing allergic reaction, due to the fact that when fish is extremely spoiled it contains a huge amount of histamine.  He will have to take medication, including steroids, for 6 months.Original date of  review was 2/2/14.  My review keeps getting pulled but I think people need to know what could happen if you eat here.",1.0 star rating

"I've been here a few times over the years. Never anything very memorable except as a nice drinking excursion. A couple of weekends ago we went on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy and understaffed. Yet the hostess had time to sit with customers at a table! Took 30 minutes to receive our bottle of cold sake. This really underscored the average sushi when we got it an hour later. The music is too loud. The service is too slow. And average sushi is maybe too kind a word for the amaebi AKA Sweet Shrimp. Certainly not fresh at all. In fact, one of the tails just fell off the shrimp. Looked like at some point it had been cut clean off and just stuck back onto the shrimp body. I sent it back. I've been to restaurants in California where they pull out 2 live shrimp and slay them in front of you. Anything like that here in Austin? Never found it when I lived in Dallas either. And on my trademarked ikura scale Umi receives a 5 out of 10. Mediocre and small portioned dollops of ikura.I overheard a burly customer (non-sushi lover chowing down on the tempura) admonishing his friend for checking his iPhone during dinner. ""This is a nice restaurant!' He barked. Umi certainly aspires to be a nice restaurant and with a few improvements it could be.",3.0 star rating
"Umi was the first sushi spot (that I knew of) south of the river that was decent. However, now that south Austin is expanding faster than Kayne West's ego, there are far better options. The decor is like something out of 1990. Neon blue lights everywhere which are so off-putting that I have always requested a table near the sushi bar, where the lights are not so intense. Sushi is decent, but nothing special. The price is reasonable though. Service is touch and go. Sometimes too attentive, sometimes not enough. If you order a bottle of wine, be sure you know how to open and pour on your own. My husband has had to work the corkscrew for the waitresses at least twice, and once the bottle is open they keep refilling your glass to the brim. If you are a quick drinker like me and Mr. L, you end up polishing a bottle off before your sushi comes out!",3.0 star rating

"It seems like everyone else has had a pretty good experience here... so this might be a little rain to the parade. We have been twice. I was not impressed when we went for happy hour one day and sat at the bar. I think the drink specials were pretty good, but the sushi just didn't sit right with me. I guess it was a little too fishy for my taste. Sometimes that happens, so I gave it another shot about a week ago for lunch and again, not impressed at all. Both times we got rolls and sushimi. It is really hard to mess up rolls (not that I couldn't, but you know what I mean). So, no complaints on those really. But something about the sushimi... not sure what it is, exactly, but not the best I've had. Both times we went in there, there were hardly any patrons... so that should say something, right?",2.0 star rating

"Uchi is one of the most popular restaurant in Austin.  We arrived a few minutes before 5 pm for the Saki Social since the website said the restaurant opens at 5 pm.  When we entered there were already about 15 people inside the restaurant waiting and a few more outside on the patio drinking.  Luckily, we got the last two spots at the sushi counter for the Saki Social.  After around a 20 minute wait we were seated.  While we were waiting, servers came by twice with complimentary snacks which was a great touch and something I haven't seen many restaurants do.We ordered just about everything on the happy hour menu.  A few standouts include the Sakana Kisetsu, which for us was amber jack that day, and the Muru Kai Mushi (mussels).  The best deal is definitely the $3 cold sake (takara) and Sapporos.  The sake had a great flavor and we were definitely feeling good after a couple rounds.  Off the main menu we ordered the Akami Te (bigeye tuna) and Gyutoro (72 hour short rib).Overall, this is a great place to do happy hour.  The food is delicious and creative and the happy hour drinks are fantastic.  I give it a 4.5 and not a 5 because I didn't think the karaage and gyutoro lived up to expectations.",4.0 star rating

"Uchi (Austin & Dallas)I first experienced Uchi at the Austin location, before it conveniently opened in Dallas. Uchi is unlike any other sushi restaurant. Although it's the focus, the way they present their dishes is so unique, you forget its sushi. Let me explain, and get to the point....Foie Gras nigiri...A perfectly seared piece of foie, perfectly portioned on its bed of rice, which perfectly cuts the dish from being overly rich. MUST HAVE. I don't care if you walk up to the sushi bar, order a single piece, and walk out without having anything more. If you do that at the very least, you have lived a wonderful life. I do not go to Uchi on a regular basis, so when I do, I go all out. I highly recommend everyone to allow the server to help you build your courses. Let them know what you definitely cannot go without, and they will take care of the rest. They have many red meat dishes as well, so again, you get lost in the sense that you're at a sushi place, and will please the carnivore community. The ambiance is casual, yet elegant, with a mid century modern vibe. Service is always on point and food is consistent, no matter the location. As I'm writing this, Uchi is my favorite OVERALL dining experience.",5.0 star rating
"Blown away.  We came from Los Angeles and were notExpecting to be going to a good sushi restaurant on this trip, but were recommended to try our Uchi.  Wow, just hands down the best sushi and sashimi we've ever had.  We went late around 10 so didn't have to wait long, but the wait was 1-2 hours before us so be ready to wait, but they do have nice lounge outdoor area to hang out as well.",5.0 star rating
Take advantage of the amazing happy hour. This place has a great ambiance and the food doesn't disappoint. The dishes are smaller but bursting with a multidimensional flavor.

"4.5* It's crazy how busy this place gets yet with the seemingly simple sushi inspired Japanese fusion menu, the flavors of each dish are unique. I've dined here twice and experienced wonderful service with each visit.The food:- some are mainstays but a few dishes change What I liked:-escolar: the first time it was ordered , it was slightly overcooked giving it a tougher texture on the edges. The second time, it was perfect. And oh man, the grilled crust and tender fillet was delightful. The salty and pungent sauce went well with it.-yellowtail anything. I had sushi roll with this, avocado and crisp shallots and it was good. The  cilantro and shallot added flavor without overpowering the fish.-yellowtail (I'm telling ya anythin) clay pot with rice. The bonito flakes make this a tad fishy like taste but in a good way. I'd order again.-yellowtail in ponzu: not fishy at all. Light and refreshing-mushroom in white ponzu: wow. Who knew u can make thinly sliced mushrooms imitate thinly sliced pieces of fish? Tasty esp for non vegetarian like me-wagyu beef: good but not a love either. Grill it yourself and it came with a tasty sauce. Well marbled, juicy small morsels of meat.-pumpkin tempura: crispy light exterior and soft pumpkin. Yum.What was alright:-salmon belly: didn't have seasoning that I recall..but tasted fresh and fatty.-smoked yellowtail (So I lied. I didn't love all the yellowtail dishes): I thought the smoke was bit heavy for the pear, almond and yucca crisp. Wish it was paired with something that can withstand it. The crisp is also hard to eat since it's so long.-raw dayboat scallops: almost melt in your mouth. I thought it could use little flavor..bland but husband liked it a lot.  There's no soy sauce on the table either for it.What I did not like:-sliced flounder w quinoa. I can detect the fishy flavor easily and this had it while I chewed.. I'm sure it's fresh and all but if you don't like the faintest taste of that, don't order. Overall it's a solid spot...as you can tell by the wait. ;)",4.0 star rating
"I love both restaurants at Uchi/Uchiko. They have SUPERB customer service at both restauraunts. Their staff is top notch,respectful and attentative. I went during happy hour both times, which was such a phenomenal deal. The difference between restauraunts is Uchi does not offer Makimono during HH, whereas Uchiko does offer Makimono style rolls. If you ever have a chance to go to either restaurant you won't be disappointed!!",5.0 star rating
"We arrived at 5:00 thinking we'd have plenty of time to join the happy hour. We soon realized we were actually late, and were lucky to get the last two happy hour seats - phew! Make sure you come early if you want a happy hour spot! Once we reserved our spot, we waited awhile, but servers passed appetizers around during this time. Once we were seated, we attacked the happy hour menu and ordered most of the items. We paired our food with probably the best drink deals - the $3 cold sake (takara) and Sapporos. One of the standouts was the Akami Te (tuna). It was so fun sitting at the counter watching the sushi being made. On top of that, our waitress was so pleasant and gave us a lot of attention and great advice on what to order. You can't really go wrong with anything you pick. Definitely make time to hit up Uchi for happy hour while you're in Austin - it's a nice break from the traditional bbq scene and a lot of fun!",5.0 star rating
"Ease up on the pretentiousness - just a tad, ok? We waited, happily, almost two hours, to find ourselves seated at the sushi bar. Great! We requested that even. Seems like the perfect spot to experience this adventure we'd been waiting on. Apparently the servers bring drinks to you at the bar and one of the 5 or 6 chefs behind the glass prepare the sushi. Obviously they are incredibly skilled at their craft. We were informed by our 'drink' server (who was lovely and welcoming) that the person ""behind the glass"" was going to be assisting us with anything and everything that had to do with the food menu. When I go to a restaurant of this caliber - which is very rare on only on special occasions - and wait for HOURS to get a seat -AND spend the kind of money that it takes to eat this delicious food- part of the experience to me, a HUGE part of this experience is the service I receive. It seemed as if the gentleman preparing our meal was almost bothered by the fact that we were there and even relieved when we were gone. No hello. No goodbye. No recommendations. No response even when inquiring about dishes we weren't familiar with.  Gave zero suggestions and barely communicated with us about what we were ordering. What the f Uchi? I get that your packed every night but your staff can do better at making people feel welcome for this kind of money. Waaaaay better. Will not go back . Damn. Wanted so much to love you. :( Go somewhere else for less money, better food and nicer staff.",2.0 star rating
"This place is a regular stop every time I visit Austin. On our last trip we came with a party of six and all ordered the 12 course tasting menu. We arrived 15 minuets early to our reservation, which was before the restaurant's opening time. Although we were early, we were warmly greeted with complementary sushi rolls and then ordered sake from the bar. The timing and service was flawless as always. We added the foie and O'Toro tasting into the mix. At roughly $75 the O'toro course did not disappoint, being served with freshly grated wasabi and aged tamari. The Sake menu is spot on with great options in all price ranges. After 14 courses we all left well satisfied and are sure to return on our next trip.",5.0 star rating
"Oh no. This place is so overrated. I'm from California so one of my Texan friends said that I needed to lower my expectations. But oh man I really just can't. You can't have a sushi restaurant and only crush the crudo style dishes and not anything else. You can have specialities but there are certain baselines a sushi restaurant needs to be able to execute decently well. I can maybe understand that there's not much fresh fish in Austin, but if I'm paying prices for Tsukiji imported fishes, I expect more. I got three fishes off of the Tsukiji menu, the oyako don from the happy hour menu, and the aki masu. So nigiri was actually just so bleh. Tiny pieces of fish (you can just see the pictures that I uploaded) and rice that's falling apart. That's just uninspiring. No wasabi underneath and you're not encourage to use soy sauce, and the fish isn't brushed with much (if anything) so it's very meh. The oyako don was the best dish I had. Nothing to complain about here. The bonito flakes were a nice addition and the crispy rice is always a favorite. But man. The best dish I had at a sushi place was the rice?The aki masu was good. I was impressed at how creative it was. I've never had candied quinoa and I thought it added nice texture to the dish. The ocean trout pieces were quite small, but I was impressed at how all the flavors complemented each other. I mean I guess you could have 4 of these dishes, but the portion size is small and the price is really, really high. Overall I found myself thoroughly unsatisfied with this place. It's expensive and I personally did not find the quality of the fish (which is usually why it commands such a high price) to be that good. Granted it was more creative than what I typically see, it just feels not great to pay so much for subpar fish. Service was friendly enough. I personally wouldn't come back.",3.0 star rating

Been to this location many times, Houston once, Dallas for soft opening and of course Uchiko.  This and Dallas are the favorite but Austin is preferred due to distance to San Antonio.  Happy hour menu change but it also means we lost some of our favorite Hama Chili but gain a few new favorites.  At this time, the happy hour market selection was spectacular.  Our typical order:Hama, foie gras, any of the roll...actually we like too much to list it all.  Not traditional Japanese, don't set expectations and I'm sure you'll love Uchi!",5.0 star rating

"I tried uchiko before I tried uchi, and I dont know why my experience at uchiko was so much better. I think maybe it was because I sat at the bar at uchiko and one of the chefs kept giving great recommendations, but here goes:Food: 3.5 I think the food that i was served at uchiko was much more fresh. We got the gyutoro nigiri at both locations, but when we got it here, it was cold and also less fatty. Disappointed, because it was our favorite dish. I feel like the options were more or less the same, except for the daily special, but they just weren't what we were looking for. We like sashimi and nigiri more than appetizers and big dishes.We came around happy hour and got hot sake for only $3 for each of the little bottles! Value.Desserts: my favorite part. We didnt get the fried milk because we already tried it, but the cherry one was SO GOOD. I dont know what it was. Maybe the sauce? The ice cream? Definitely try it!We also tried the chai flavor one and it was not bad! The cherry just outshined it.Service: 5Great server, hospitable and decent reccomendations.

I love my mother and grandmother's cooking, but even their food pales in comparison to the ingenious Uchi menu. The fresh ingredients, innovative flavors, excellent service and amazing blend of modern and traditional cuisine blew our minds. The service is amazing and they explain their menu and their specials really well. Regardless of what you order, they bring it out in the order they know will enhance the experience. We got the Hamachi Chili (excellent ponzu, bright, citrusy, very refreshing), hot rock (interactive experience, guided instructions on best cooking time and with another refreshing ponzu that was incredible), hamachi nabe (I will never forget the dancing bonito flakes, and the experience of watching the perfect yolk being mixed into the crunchy, yet soft and flavorful rice), the brussel sprouts agemono - which we got two of because they were so packed with flavor we couldn't get enough, some atlantic salmon and ora king salmon (special menu) sashimi - loved the latter the most, it was sweet and light and came with a sauce that cut through the salmon fattiness. The only downside was an anchovy and broccolini number that was suuuuper acidic and we couldn't taste neither the fish nor the broccolini. Four of us were so satisfied with this that we forgot we even ordered a spicy crunchy tuna roll! Since we had a birthday amongst us, we even got the chocolate ganache for dessert - couldn't have asked for more!",5.0 star rating
"I hate when a place I used to really like just doesn't cut it anymore. Here's the nitty gritty:Got rid of manzana salsa, best thing E-v-e-r, why is it gone?Tortillas are store bought now. Yep. Hubs realized just by looking. Chicken Rostizado still good but way too much chicken to salad ratio. It was perfect before. Now, not so much. A surprising good:Pambato sandy was good. But note: Very messyThe biggest thing: prices. We very quickly realized after a few things: no one around us the past 2 times had ever been been there, out of towners = tourist trap, hence prices that are out of range for what you get. IMO.  Sad, as they had some items I've always liked. But it's just not worth the effort for us.",3.0 star rating

"Disappointed. My roommate and I try to go to a new brunch spot every Sunday so when la condesa was brought up we didn't hesitate. We were pleased that there was no wait time and immediately sat down. They have $2 bloody Mary's/mimosas on their brunch special. My roommate had a Bloody Mary, I had a mimosa and neither is is were disappointed. Our server asked if he could bring us some chips and salsa (failing to mention it would be extra). We were served chips, guacamole and four different types of salsa (all of which were pretty underwhelming) for the total whopping price of $17. We then ordered a tortilla soup, which I will admit was incredibly delicious. Nothing at all wrong with their soup. I honestly wished I would have stopped there. I then ordered chilaquiles. Big mistake. It came totally cold and I had to send it back. When it came back to me it didn't look any better. Long story short I didn't end up eating it. My roommate wasn't pleased with her dish either and we both shelled out $40+ Unfortunately I will not return to La Condesa, even though they had a great tortilla soup and great ambiance to their restaurant.   No thanks.",2.0 star rating
"Trace is pretty much the bomb. I've only been twice, once for a Yelp event and once for a (slightly ill-fated) dinner. The yelp event proved that Trace can really trot out its flavors, lift its proverbial skirts & wow us all - we got to try it one torturous bite at a time, but literally everything they provided was delectable (lookin' at you BLT/tomato water shots!) Hopefully this effect wasn't just because we were all starving and ready to lick the table for crumbs. I don't think it was purely psychological though, truly.The dinner was good-to-great as well. My dining companion & I shared the scallops, which were by & large some of the very best scallops I've ever had, perfectly prepared. I kind of wanted to arm wrestle her for the last bites but being her birthday, it seemed like bad form. I ordered the pork cassoulet (which I'm a sucker for) and she ordered the oxtail agnolotti, and again because it was her birthday I relented from grabbing her plate and running outside to gnaw on it under Willie. My cassoulet was pretty tasty, but I got a little shorted on pork belly - my skillet had plenty of sausage & tenderloin (on the dry side) but the pork belly was a little skimpy. Her agnolotti was killer though, so I tried not to eat up her meal and be a worse dining companion than I was. You're welcome friend, happy birthdayyesIwouldlikeanotherbite! Something or other for dessert - not sure how this dish is a blank card in my mental rolodex, but it is. But I can vouch for how tasty their desserts are overall because I previous sampled at least 6 of them, and possibly within mere seconds of each other. Trust!I'd love to go back for brunch, dinner, lunch whatever...it's killer, love me some Trace. I want to go to there.",5.0 star rating
"La Condesa has been one of my go-to spots in downtown Austin for several years. Whether its for a yummy and unique brunch, cocktails with friends, a business lunch or a scrumptious dinner date, La Condesa always meets my expectations and leaves my tummy completely satisfied. Some of my favorites include:* The Alma Blanca  - best.cocktail.ever. Not kidding, sometimes I literally stop in just to sip on one of these babies. A habanero-infused cazadores blanco, muddled with corn and pineapple juice, and topped with a hibiscus-rose-infused salt rim.. I mean, how could you go wrong. Try it, I promise you will love it!* Guacamole Tasting - its a tasting of all their guacamoles & salsas, including: traditional, chipotle purée & toasted almond, and jumbo lump crab with apple. Super delish. #JustDoIt* Chilangos - one of the most unique brunch dishes in town. Its a quinoa croquette topped with chorizo, poached eggs, baby arugula and salsa verde. Nom, nom, nom.* Acapulco Ceviche - I always go this route when I am looking for something light. Its extremely refreshing. * Pescado Tacos - If I am a little more hungry I go with this dish: snapper, cabbage, chipotle mayo, and salsa. Yum in my tum!!!* Elotes - this is their Mexican-style street corn, and the perfect side dish. I always ask them to take it off the cob for me. But be sure to have them remind the chef to mix up all the ingredients for you pretty well, otherwise it can be pretty messy.* Boca Negra - this dessert is actually a new find for me. I highly recommend it, and promise you won't be sorry you ordered it. Its kind of like a molten cake with a bit of a spicy kick, caramelized banana and brown sugar-banana ice cream.If you are in the downtown area, you should definitely stop by La Condesa. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, cool bar area, and delicious food and beverage. I will continue going back for years to come!",5.0 star rating
"I had nothing short of a fabulous experience here. I have two separate parts for this place - Malverde, their upstairs private event space and the downstairs restaurant, La Condesa. Malverde--I arrive to assist with setup and to ensure the place is up to the client's standards. I was greeted very nicely by the manger upstairs that evening and we went over a few things the client wanted and he was more then willing to oblige and even knew of these requests before I got there. He didn't seem bothered when I talked to him about the request. He offered me water and I waited for the clients to arrive. Malverde is a cute and perfect place for a little cocktails and apps. There's a small outdoor patio for people to visit also. The bar is large and aesthetically pleasing - the staff was wonderful up there! La Condesa- While the clients are drinking and chatting away upstairs, I came down for dinner. I ate a late lunch so I had a small dinner but boy was it yummy! The house salad is WONDERFUL. I need that dressing recipe ASAP. The salsas are fantastic, something for everyone. Avocado blended with tomatillo, tomatillo, chipotle and some other one that was the hottest of the 4 but I wasn't disappointed. My server was on it. Extremely patient and courteous---and well versed with the menu and ingredients. When I ordered my salad without cheese it prompted him to let me know there's butter in the rice. With his help, I stayed away from all the dairy tonight and I'm thankful for that, haha. I will be back with my girlfriends -- even the upper bar is cute for drinks before a night on the town. Service was perfect and the food was delish. No complaints here.",5.0 star rating
"TRACE was okay. We went to TRACE for brunch a few weeks ago and although the food was good and drinks were good, the only thing that blew me away were the delicious donuts and sauces that we had for dessert. The atmosphere is nice - modern, clean feel. Prices for the food and drinks were quite high. Be prepared to drop $16 on a cocktail. Luckily, Liza K had a coupon, so we got in and out for a pretty reasonable amount.The service was lackluster. Our waiter seemed disinterested in his job. Not a bad experience, but not the friendliest.Considering the price, I expected more.",3.0 star rating
"Let's just say I don't look kindly on a place that prides itself on customer service when a goup of us out on a dinner date are asked to leave the bar/restaurant because the ""guy who owns the block"" wants to make himself comfortable and watch a different football game than we had been watching.I didn't appreciate the manner in which we were told to leave...""get the F out of here"", after contesting (partly in jest). But what really turned me off wasn't the fact that some rich guy liked to throw his weight around, but rather how all the staff got right behind him and flipped from being hospitable to mindless, kiss-ups who wanted to disregard all they had been told about the importance of customer service in an attempt to impress their boss (or whoever he was). I'll admit there was a young girl working the bar who seemed embarrassed about the situation and was apologetic. Unfortunately that's not enough to make me ever want to go back.And being the good people we are (or fools), we even paid our tab after being asked to leave. Hindsight is 20/20.  I'll be sticking to the Four Seasons from now on.",1.0 star rating
"So I was with Scott M. the night that incident took place.  Sure, one of the guys we were with was being a little bit vocal in expressing his irritation that they were changing the game.  Sure, the game he was watching was Michigan-Notre Dame and not Texas.  But he was well within the lines of polite public behavior, and he had called ahead and asked if they would put that game on and they had agreed.  And the W bar was showing the Texas game not 50 feet away.At the end of the day what we observed was two things:1) Someone in a position of power elected to egregiously abuse that power.  No one in our party used a single word of profanity throughout the ENTIRE incident.  The group that apparently owns the place (Stratus?) responded with abundant profanity and the threat of violence (I believe the phrase was ""Do I need to take you outside and kick your f*****g a**?"").2) The staff (aside from the female bartender who tried to warn us and keep it civil) piled on quickly and thoroughly.  Again, to quote, ""Yeah, you need to get the f*** out of here.""I used to love the W bar and Trace.  We would go often ahead of events at the Moody theater.  Never again.",1.0 star rating

"Came here with a friend who's a chef here and it was one of the greatest decisions ever.First things first, the service is GREAT from being seated and all though out the meal our server was very attentive and helpful. I accidentally spilled some water and guacamole and he wiped the table each time. He was very good at refilling our drinks and answering any questions we had.I'd like to start by highly recommending the ceviches. We had three and all of them were so mouth watering! This was my first time having ceviche and if you're a big sashimi person like me they are to die for! We had the hamachi, scallop, and tuna ceviche! Hmmmm! If you're with a group of friends or just really like guacamole you need to try the guac tasting, 4 different kinda of guac and salsa with delicious chips, what's not to like, everything tasted very fresh! Now to the good part the main entrees, I had the pork belly and the marinated vegetables that sat on top of it was very good (the bread/pita thing that was inter neath the entire entree was kinda hard to chew so I didn't care much for it) but the entree was delicious. My fellow companions has the octopus, cauliflower steak, and empanada all very delicious, the squid especially was cooked to perfection and sat on top of duck fat potatoes... MhmmmThe desserts were also good and very delicious and plating was in point! P.S. If you're allergic to mango don't get the papaya sorbet. Had to learn this the hard way...",5.0 star rating
"This was a massive disappointment.I took a client here for a business lunch at the last minute, because Lambert's had a long wait (we weren't able to make reservations). It was a cold day and this was the nearest nice lunch spot. I was confident that Trace would be a great spot to take an out of town client. HUGE MISTAKE.We waited 25 minutes after being seated for someone to say hello and offer us water. This was incredibly uncomfortable for us an a waste of our client's time. The food was fine, which is why I am giving this review two stars. Massive pieces of bibb lettuce were tasty but nearly impossible to eat without using a knife. The buns on our salmon burgers and sandwiches were clearly not made in-house, and so many places in town do take the time to make their buns (or at least purchase decent ones).There was absolutely nothing special about the food, whatsoever. Nothing. And the fact that there were empty tables when we arrived but it took us over 1.5 hours to grab sandwiches is horrible. Thanks to Trace, I was a horrible host today.",2.0 star rating

The food was great but pretty small entrees for the price. Gratuity was included for our large party, not sure if that's every party or just large parties, but one of our girls paid for half the check and didn't realize that it was included so double tipped.

"My partner and I walked in on a Saturday afternoon without reservations. The hostess told us it would be a thirty minute wait or open seating in the bar. Because the full menu was available in the bar, and there were bar seats and one table for two, we picked the bar. On the weekends, they serve their brunch menu between eleven to three. We started with the $2 mimosas. Partner got the huevos rancheros and I got the tacos del día with Texas redfish. The portion sizes were moderate not excessive. My fish tacos had plenty of cabbage, chunks of grilled fish, and weren't greasy at all. They came with Mexican rice and black beans. I also swiped a bit of the guacamole from the table next to us because they left 1/2 cup behind! I thought it was fine, as in, tasted like how I make it at home. Overall, food was fine. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't terrible either. Service was good. Accepts credit cards. Moderately-priced because it is in downtown after all. Very upscale atmosphere with stylish design. I had the seen the mixed reviews for the place on Yelp, but was glad we checked it out. We were looking for something within walking distance of our downtown hotel.",3.0 star rating

"We came as a large group and we were seated in the basement level in the private dining room. Because of that, they only offer the prix fixe option for the entire group. With that being said, I enjoyed everything that was placed in front of me. Nothing was poorly made. The 3 salsas and guacamole that they served with the chips at the beginning was delicious. I could have become full from that alone.I really enjoyed the appetizers particularly the mushroom flatbread was a hit with the group. My husband really enjoyed the grilled corn. The meat in the entrees were cooked perfectly - juicy and not overdone whether it was the chicken or the beef. The pitchers of margaritas that were made were great and not watered down. They were strong but still delicious.Service was prompt and friendly. The private dining room is absolutely gorgeous and a must if you are celebrating a special event! It's the perfect space.I'd return just to order off the regular menu. I have no doubt if they're this good at serving a large group, the food will not disappoint.",5.0 star rating
"I went here on a Travelzoo - and WOW does that make this place 5 stars for sure.  As I am a single girl on a budget - I can only give it 4 stars because without the Travelzoo it is a bit pricey.  The TZ allowed us to pick six - yes you read that right six of the appetizer items - and wow!  They were all amazing.  The figs and pickles were my favorite, but my girlfriend loved that Duck Bacon and the blue cheese.  I then had the trout - YUM.  The crispy finish all over the outside of the fish was amazing.  So tasty and the artichokes and other dressings were wonderful - I am a big veggie fan too - so honestly this was my favorite part of the disk - very fresh!  My friend had the Niman Burger - she loved it.  I do not eat beef - but it looked amazing - and HUGE!  She ate it up!  BUT THEN - the big kahuna was the DRUNKEN DONUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!  OMGoodey Deliciousness.  They bring out these 4 large donut hole looking things covered in sugar and Cinnamon (I think) - they were so pillowy yet so friend and oh so bad for you it is good - then this is the really great part - and I would swim in these sauces if I could - a ooey gooey peanut butter sauce that has BAILEY in it!  Then a chocolate sauce that has some kind of liquor - sorry forgot in it - whiskey I think - and then a gooey marshmallow/creamy sauce - Oh goodness - drop those over these pillow of goodness and you will be in HEAVEN!  I honestly thought I had gone blind - but it was just so good I closed my eyes to focus on the tastes in my mouth - and I forgot to open my eyes-  yes so good basic motor skills will leave you! :)  RECOMMEND - even if you just go for the dessert - go to TRACE.  Oh not to mention - the waiters are super hot - the place is swank - and the location - HELLO ATX DOWNTOWN  at the W!  YES SIR MAY I HAVE ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER !  Love this place!!  So again 5 stars - except I am on a budget so I cannot do those additional ""and anothers"" too often ;).",4.0 star rating
"My husband and I had a date night this past Friday at Trace. We had oysters and the charcuterie apps, the lamb entree and quail entree. Everything was delicious! Of course the charcuterie pretty much filled us up so we could only eat half our entrees. The lamb was cooked two ways with carrots and a raisin chutney. It was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented. I think the quail was the surprise favorite--two quail on the plate with the most delicious medley of corn, cilantro, and I don't know what else; the flavors were just crazy. It's probably one of the best things I've ever eaten at Trace. We didn't get dessert because we were so full. Great service, friendly professional staff.

"Giving Yelp reviews isn't really my thing but I had such a good experience here (dare I say it was perhaps my best dining experience ever!?) so I felt the need to spread the word. From start to finish, I had superb service (keep your fingers crossed that you get in David the Waiter's section, he was excellent). Even the management seemed top notch. Very attentive, checking on us periodically.  The great service and ambiance was only matched by the fantastic food. And, don't miss out on the dessert.  Seriously - you'll thank me. It almost looked too fancy to eat.  So, take it from me, this place is worth checking out. Perfect for a date night.  Or a girl's night. The bachelorette party next to me seemed like they were having a fantastic time too.  I'd recommend this place without reservation.",5.0 star rating
"Decent food, but small portions for the price. Like many other reviewers, I went with a small group and was told the dishes are meant to be shared ""family style"".

"Meh. This place is just another $14 margarita hipster spot. I had a friend from college arrive in Austin for the first time on business. We got together while she was here, and I decided on La Condesa based on some good things I'd heard.We arrived at 8pm on a Tuesday and were told it was a 45 minute wait. We proceeded to the bar area and ordered the aforementioned $14 margarita and screamed over the music in order to be heard. After a 75 minute wait, we were finally seated. It's a sort of tapas-but-not-really place. Shared plates? Or not? The waitress didn't give us much direction. We ordered 4 plates for the 3 of us. Food was ok. So, between paying for parking (in Austin! but technically not the restaurant's fault), the drink and the food, I spent about $75 and left with a sore throat from yelling through our conversation.

That's when you know you've hit the true professionals. Our server was always present but yet remained invisible - no interruptions but very meticulous. He met our needs but gave us our privacy.

"I usually come here for brunch and the menu is great and the service has always been friendly and pleasant however this week I was attending a show at ACL and decided to stop by for a quick bite before the show and the experience was completely different.  The friendly host staff greeted me and immediately found me a table in the bar area.  Everything went downhill from there.  I waited 16 minutes before a female waitress finally came to my table - she walked by me several times and assisted tables next to me and not once did she acknowledge me and say ""I'll be right with you"" - nothing.  When I finally get to order I asked about the venison tacos that I have always ordered and they had been removed from the menu.  Not her fault, ok, I ask for an alternate taco on the menu, a la carte and a Pisco Sour cocktail.  She tells me that they can not do a simple a la carte order of 1 taco.  This is absolutely ridiculous, it may be restaurant policy, but making 1 taco that is already offered on the menu should not be a big deal - this is really bad customer service - every Mexican restaurant I have ever been to allows you to order 1 taco.  I didn't want a big meal so I just ordered the cocktail since I was short on time and the waitress is visibly annoyed and isn't shy about displaying her bad attitude.  After delivering my drink order and check, service was absent.  Very unpleasant experience.  When I go out for a meal, I don't need a nasty attitude from an insolent waitress.  I won't be visiting here again for dinner service again.",2.0 star rating
"Positives: great happy hour drink specials. Negatives: basically everything else. After being told we were going to be seated in 30-45 minutes and sitting down an hour later, we looked at the menu. I ordered the arabico taquitos and received two small extremely salty tacos for 16 dollars. My friend ordered the chicken mole, and it too was so salty as to be basically unedible. They also charged us an extra dollar for a refill on a small tin of salsa. The waiter got a bad attitude when he was asked to put different prices on different cards, and no one cared when we told them how terrible our meals are. This place is a rip off with nasty food.",2.0 star rating
"I may have to come back and re-review since we ate off of a set menu. As it stands right now I had a 5 star experieince at TRACE. We went for the Valentine's day dinner. Its fun to get all dressed up and go to dinner every now and then and TRACE is the place to do it. The place is beautiful, its dark but no cluttered so you have this very sexy low lit vibe going on. We got an awesome, velvet corner booth so that we could see the entire reastaurant. Our server was sweet and helpful. The menu was set for V-day but there were a few choices you can make. Like most of these things you get a choice of app, entree and dessert. I got the crab salad to start, it was wonderfully fresh with grapefruit and avocado. The entree was my favorite part, a slice of beef tenderloin and braised short rib so tender it disintegrated as soon as it hit my toungue. I didnt need a knife, well I guess except for the accompanying mushrooms that were also savory and complemented the meat perfectly. For dessert, nutella stuffed beigneits. Wow these were rich, I loved every minute of biting the fried dough with Nutella oozing our of the side of it. The included champagne at the end cleaned my palate and had me ready to float away to dream of... well most of all that damn deliscious short rib. I also want to try TRACE for brunch, I hear their shrimp and grits is hard to beat. I guess this review will have a sequel. Till then....",5.0 star rating

"Came for my birthday and was not disappointed.We visited Trace on a Sunday evening. And because I am an old fart, I appreciated the fact that the restaurant was not busy. There were only 4 full tables there, which means I could hear my dinner companions. I assume that on more social evenings, this particular restaurant has more of a scene.I didn't want a scene on my birthday. I wanted a memorable meal. And that is exactly what I got at Trace.We selected 4 small plates and 1 entree to share between the two of us. (As always, that winds up being about 1 plate too many -- when will I learn?) Some of the dishes were incredible, and others were quite forgettable. I had read on Yelp to get the chickpea fritters. My recommendation? Skip them. They're kind of like cornbread sticks, and were a bit heavy, considering they could be 25% of your entire meal. Don't get me wrong - they're lovely and their dipping sauce is great. But I didn't think they were worth writing home about. (And yet, here I am....writing Yelp about them...)Service was spotty. Plates were once cleared twice before a new dish was brought out, and yet between a different course, the plates weren't cleared at all.

"I am a Jo's groupie through and through! I love this place and everything about it. The Belgian Bomber is the most delicious iced coffee (next to the Iced Turbo, which is its ""full strength"" cousin) that's not TOO sweet, but still hits the spot.For breakfast, the migas taco is always fresh and delicious and for lunch I love the Greek salad, which is overflowing with fresh ingredients and lettuce you know was chopped 5 minutes before serving it to you. I love how they mix the dressing on the salad already (though I am sure you can request it on the side). The atmosphere is fun and cool, with bar seating, tables, and an outside patio. Free wifi is a perk, and there's never too much of a crazy line. This is one of my Austin go-tos and I love it (so much). [see what I did there?]",5.0 star rating
We stayed in Austin for 4 days and 3 days we stopped at Downtown Jo's for coffee and breakfast. This place just embodies the Austin vibe. It's inviting and clean with a touch of weirdness. They have amazing breakfast tacos and the best huevos rancheros. The iced turbo was so unique and addicting we always got one each to go after finishing our meals. The inside is super fun but the patio is wonderful. We sat on the patio each morning just to enjoy the city and people more. The location is great. There's a bunch of cool shops near by and the prices are very affordable for being right downtown. This is a must go if visiting downtown Austin. Try any of their coffees you won't be disappointed.,5.0 star rating
"Coffee at Jo's is very good. We all know that. I had heard the burgers were good but I don't think I have had one before. I would remember.Look at the picture. A big, juicy, perfectly-cooked, beautifully dressed burger. Swiss cheese, bacon and mushrooms. It was excellent. Full of flavor, crispy fresh lettuce and tomato, a bun that adds flavor but does not overpower, perfectly cooked mushroom, and not too greasy. Just great.It has to be one of the best burgers I have had in a long time.",5.0 star rating
"I live for Jo's! The almond milk latte is amazing and the outdoor patio is the perfect chill spot downtown on a weekend morning.

"Holy. HOLY. Best veggie burger I've ever had. Wtf. My mind was blown. A coworker recommended it to me, and y'all my life has been changed.I didn't know I could love a veggie burger this much. I may be overhyping it, but I am a person who loves meat and great burgers. I very rarely venture off-meat when eating a burger and even then, the last non-meat burger I ate was the impossible burger. Which is supposed to mimic meat.Let me tell you...this veggie burger is FULL of flavor. My coworker advised against adding mayo, but mayo is my fav condiment so I couldn't go without it. I don't regret my decision. The mayo added just the right flavor imo, and damn, this burger is big.I was stuffed. The fries are good. Thick cut and just crispy enough on the outside and retained a ton of heat on the inside. Go my order to-go and the meal stayed warm during my 15 min drive to my destination.Service could've been faster, but that may have been due to not enough people working the front end. I'd 10/10 recommend the veggie burger here to anyone.",4.0 star rating
"I can only speak about the takeout experience. It seemed like a very casual place, with lots of friendly people. They have these adorable and yummy novelty sugar cookies.

"All I really wanted to do was run to the bathroom.But the strong aromas of the food here got the best of my stomach's cries, so I eventually gave in. When my eyes wandered on the menu, the Mushroom Patty Melt was the very first thing that caught my eye and I went with in. I didn't think much when I ordered it--I love almost anything and everything in the fungi family tree, so naturally, I knew it couldn't be bad no matter what. Let me tell you, this was absolutely delicious and probably one of the most memorable food experiences in my short time in Austin--beef patty with melted (READ: STRINGY) swiss cheese, topped with mushrooms, sandwiched with Texas toast breads and herb aioli spread--it was amazing. Granted, I felt like shit afterwards but it was worth it. It was juicy, flavorful, and the toast was cooked perfectly and the herb aioli went well with the mushrooms. If this had potato buns, I think I'd be overwhelmed but since it was on a toast, it wasn't heavy and was just the right amount of food I needed to refuel since I'd been walking around Downtown Austin for hours. A bit pricey for the sandwich itself ($10.50), which doesn't come with any sides. The outside seating is really nice and chill, especially for people watching, but beware of the pigeons since the trees hang above the seats and you can see pigeon droppings on the tables and chairs. Thankfully, the birds let me eat in peace. Can't say I'll have the same luck next time!",4.0 star rating

"Jo's was a cool spot in downtown Austin. They have many options for breakfast and lunch. On Sundays, they stop serving breakfast at noon: FYI! I made it in the neck of time luckily so I could try the Migas. The Migas were on point and definitely met my expectations. It came with two tortillas, eggs with onions and peppers, beans and potatoes. Definitely a great portion for the price! I wouldn't say the staff stood out in anyway to me and the process of ordering was a tad slow. I know Sunday's are a popular day, but I think you should prepare for that! For a coffee shop, I wasn't overly pleased with my coffee. Maybe I just got the wrong thing, but the coffee didn't ""wow"" me. Overall, decent experience.

Came here just for the iced turbo but ended up getting the mushroom patty melt too. It's definitely not worth the $10.50 I paid. Shouldn't a patty melt be melted? I opened my sandwich to find a whole slice of unmelted cheese slathered with mayo. This was pretty much a hamburger on toast with a few mushrooms. 4/10 would not eat here again.

"I always say that I'll give any restaurant a second try, I did that here and it failed again. Both in costumer service and food. Our waiter spent more time flirting with his coworkers than he did with any of his tables.  I think we saw him to take the order and give us the check, he never stopped by to ask about the food. Agh, the food. I had a seafood linguini, it was tragic. The pasta was served too al dente and the seafood was almost non-existent. Our bread was stale and the appetizer tasted like it was re-warmed, poorly. The only thing descent in the whole meal was the ice tea, which an assistant accidentally poured into my lap and all over my white shorts (now ruined). No manager came over to apologize, just the assistant who made the mistake. Accidents happen, but a manager should at least stop by and offer a free desert or something.  But we got none of that.  My opinion, subpar food and terrible service.",1.0 star rating
So happy to give Taverna 5 stars! My daughter was turning 18 and wanted to have her birthday dinner here with 14 of her friends.

"My husband and I really like Taverna. We've had mixed experiences with servers, but the food is always great. I think it is a little pricey compared to some other places downtown, but that hasn't stopped us from coming here. If you come during lunchtime they give you an order of their focaccia bread for free - yum!!They have half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays. Also $2.00 Mimosas for brunch on the weekend (be sure to make a reservation!) Try the risotto or the gnocchi. They are both excellent choices!!",4.0 star rating

"Meh. I'm not impressed. (I can only base this review on Brunch.)They need to update their site. $1 mimosas are no more. Service was pretty good. Friendly server. Relatively attentive. Drink service was a bit slow. I ordered the Taverna Hash, which is supposedly their specialty. I love poached egg dishes. But poached eggs need to be done perfectly. And I'm sorry, but if your job is cooking, I expect you to be able to nail it. The first dish that was given to me was so under cooked that the whites of my eggs ran as much as the yolk. Um, I'm not a meathead, I don't do raw eggs. The server wanted to know if I wanted them to redo it with a different style of eggs. No, I want properly poached eggs, thanks. Well the second try was over cooked. But I sort of expected this, and I didn't want my friends waiting on me all day, so I didn't send it back. The entire dish was dry and relatively flavorless. Give me the same ingredients at home and I could make a dish 10X better at home. I'd maybe try this place for dinner, since one of our party ordered a regular menu item and was very happy with it.",2.0 star rating

We all got bellinis and unanimously agreed we did not like them, I didn't even bother/want to finish mine. We then ordered the vegetarian pizza to share. My friend and I did not like it but my gf said it was a solid 6/10, I'll go with 3/10 though. Id rather take that money and go buy a Costco pizza, no disrespect, Costco pizza is actually fire if you've never tried it.",2.0 star rating
"Had brunch here over the weekend and while I feel 3.5 is probably an appropriate rating for the food, the ambiance and location are great and the service was very friendly so I'd give it a 4 overall.  We started off with a mimosa and a peach bellini, both which were very tasty.  The eggs benedict I ordered were pretty nice as well with perfectly cooked poached eggs and plenty of hollandaise and ham.  The new potatos on the side were not the best, and while passable, they just didn't have that super fresh hot off the skillet feel to them and weren't crisp on the outside and warm and tender on the inside, like you'd hope for.  Overall a decent Brunch spot, with a nice amount of outdoor seating in a good people watching area and a nice interior as well.Worth checking out.",4.0 star rating
"My favorite part about Taverna is the outside Euro/NY cafe style street corner seating. Outside of that, I wasn't very impressed.For the food, I can only speak about the brunch and I will speak on it as follows:Eggs Benedict with Crab meat - Nothing special and the crab meat actually had a fishy taste to it. I'm sure I do not have to tell you, but any fresh quality seafood should not taste fishy. The side potatoes were unremarkable as well and some were not cooked enough.Vanilla French Toast - Meh, nothing to write home about or provide repeat business for. It sounded much better on the menu then what it turned out to be. The menu mentioned something about mascarpone which was no where to be found.I saw reviews raving about the bellinis. I thought it was ok, but when it comes to liquor, I'm a whiskey drinker so that could be part of my lack of enthusiasm for it.The service was decent. I have a friend who really likes their dinner menu. I'd be willing to give it a try sometime, but I'm in no rush.",2.0 star rating

The creaminess paired well with the smokiness of the bacon and the hint of spice from the peppers. The staff (Mack)was friendly and attentive.

"Don't let the allure of $1 mimosa specials deceive you -- La Taverna does not do brunch right. Really, from top to bottom, I expected a much better experience from a place that managed to snag a piece of prime real estate in downtown Austin. Honestly, I wish we had been able to score outdoor seating because it was very clear that our waiter had not showered in several days, and he really could've used some air. Or maybe some Fabreze. I ordered the special for the day: a Crab Meat Benedict with asparagus. Why not try something the chef wanted to whip up? Boy, what a mistake. In a word, it was awful. The crab meat seemed a bit past its date and sported a distinct seafood market flavor - like what I imagine what crab would taste like if you dropped it on the floor and then picked it back up. The English muffin was stale and flavorless. It looked as though they tried to toast it, but by the time it reached the table, it was stone-cold and soggy. I suppose the hollandaise sauce was alright, but once topped on the rest of the dish, it just made everything all the more miserable. The best thing about the special was the breakfast potatoes, which was the plate's only redeeming factor (which in itself is kinda pathetic). The scrambled eggs were alright - a healthy serving of pepper did the trick to help bring some flavor to them. Lastly, the $1 mimosas we ordered tasted like they were made with watered down orange juice and a teaspoon of champagne. Yikes.Oh, and did I mention the waiter literally stunk? Oh, I did? Well, good, because he smelled awful. If you somehow for me to come again and endure the wait and the rather dingy lighting, I would probably play it safe and order an omelette. It's hard to mess those up, right?",1.0 star rating
"I'm severely attracted to cheap mimosas, but fortunately this place has great food as well.  This is our favorite brunch spot in Austin, they have a great outdoor patio, and I usually see at least two man buns every time I visit.  Great spot to eat some hash and rehash the prior night's follies.Most recently I had the lasagna which is superb!  Hearty and so hot I burnt my tongue twice.",5.0 star rating
"Definitely go for happy hour and definitely get the prosciutto, fig and blue cheese pizza. The happy hour specials are incredible, but your eyes will definitely light up and be bigger than your stomach. Make sure you split a pizza, as I'm sure most human beings would, but a friend and I thought that two pizzas and bruschetta would be sufficient. Be warned, however, happy hour has extremely limited seating only in the bar area, so you wanna go with a small group and make sure to snatch up two or three seats quickly!",4.0 star rating
"Super impressed!  This is the most popular brunch in town for a reason.  Sure, parking's a bitch, the wait is daunting, and they won't seat incomplete parties but it's alllllllllll worth it in the end.  Just remember that there dollar mimosas available for consumption before/during/after your meal.  They have your standard egg items mixed in with some Italian fare like pizzas and paninis. I definitely recommend checking out the specials on the board; my recent visit featured this amazing butternut squash pizza with arugula and truffle oil, I shamelessly devoured the entire thing during a bout of mimosa munchies.",5.0 star rating
"Undoubtedly a stunning restaurant, but perhaps only visit the Cedar Tavern for a happy hour drink because that seems like your best bet at this place. Their drinks are mediocre -- each one that we tried seemed like I­t­ was missing a key ingredient to make I­t­ special. Case in point: anytime tea, an underwhelming display of the many intriguing ingredients listed on the menu. Sweet heat, another cocktail on the menu, was equally lagging despite the arguably key ingredients to make for a harmonious blend of ""sweet"" & ""heat."" You're better off getting a bottle of wine or a classic cocktail like a Manhattan. We tried every Small Fare plate, so here are the top picks: 1) crab & cornbread -- delicious and very shareable for 4 people; 2) beef tartare -- really nice flavors. Entrees: If you know what jambalaya is, stay away from their Redfish Jambalaya. This is simply a dish with redfish, there is no rice (key ingredient in jambalaya) to be seen on the plate. Green lentil jambalaya is a sad excuse for this classic, beloved Southern dish. Waitstaff: our waitress was so uninterested and unhelpful that I­t­ truly put a damper on our dining experience. I, one person, asked for a recommendation and she proceeded to recommend the $85 chateaubriand that *serves 2-3* -- and Then said that she ""was bored of the Redfish Jambalaya,"" which in retrospect was a helpful statement considering how unenjoyable that dish was. Check out the historic cedar tavern because that bar is an impressive display of craftsmanship. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend.",2.0 star rating
We went there recently when friends were visiting from out of town. Let me just say the bar alone is worth the visit and you don't need reservations for the bar area.

"Eberly has an intriguing Austin pride backstory and an absolutely beautiful interior that never gives away its former life as a humble print shop. The on-trend menu offers a variety of small seasonal plates presented artfully at spendy prices. Portions are tiny with the exception of the shareable seafood pot ($95) and 32 ounce aged rib eye ($89). There is, of course, a retro/craft cocktail selection. I dined here with a group of 5 ladies on a stormy Tuesday night. We shared 2 appetizers ($16-22), 2 full entrees ($25-27), 2 sides ($9-10), and 4 desserts ($12 each) plus drinks for around $50 per person plus tip. Everyone enjoyed the food and the service was just fine. Standouts I'd eat again were the lump crab cornbread starter, the tender spare rib entree, and the decadent chocolate dessert.The path past the kitchen leads to a sort of hidden bar area, the Cedar Tavern, with a gorgeous antique mahogany bar salvaged from a famous past life in New York City. This hopping area serves a separate food menu at a somewhat more affordable price point. The much-discussed unisex restroom is back there, too.Aspects I'd like to see improved at Eberly would be the lighting and the noise level. During peak dinner service (8pm), it is so loud in both the front dining area and the back room bar that it's almost impossible to hold a conversation. Many of the seating options are long narrow tables so that groups of more than 2 can hardly hear anyone more than a foot away without shouting. For such an elegant space, it's a shame that it sounds like a summer camp mess hall in there. As for the lighting, it is too dark to read a menu or see the food on the dish; we had to keep turning on our phone flashlights to get an idea of what we were eating. I enjoy the romance of low lighting as much as any lady, but perhaps you could add a few more dim lights throughout the dining room?There's much to love at Eberly and they are really just getting started with only 3 months of service under their belts. I do hope they succeed in our increasingly tough fine dining market. I look forward to trying them again for a naturally lit daytime meal (if they ever do open up before 5p) and most definitely enjoying a beverage or two on that rooftop terrace when the weather permits.Know before you go:Reservations are a must for full service. The dining area serves from 5p - 10p, so not so many seatings are available each night.Valet is complimentary & pretty much mandatory, but you may get lucky self-parking on Bluff Street or at one of the parking lots down the block (park at your own risk). I hate waiting for my car and/or letting others drive it, so the no self-parking situation is a bit irritating to me.",3.0 star rating
"So like everyone else said, the decor here is awesome. I came for the first time for brunch and I'd say this is definitely a place that makes a statement when you walk in, so it's good for a date or a special occasion. I got a Bellini that was super strong, but in a good way! We got the pop-tart which was fun and super delicious. Fuels the inner child in all of us. We got the brunch board which was really fresh and split the croque madame pizza. The pizza is HUGE. Definitely enough for 2 people. It was also very good. The servers take your plates almost instantly when you are finished. All the servers were very friendly and prompt. I'll be coming back for lunch/dinner or even just a late night drink at their awesome bar.

Make sure you make reservations as it gets crowded and there is limited dining space. Complimentary valet is ! We got seating at 8:30. Not sure how you get to dine in the beautiful den you see in pictures. I requested ,didn't get a table there. Bummer. They have 2 bars one up front and their infamous bar in the back which is beautiful and perfect for cocktails if you didn't want to dine. Will certainly have to return to try more drinks!Food: Brussels sprouts and cheese board both were delicious and beautifully plated. We ordered the whole fish (fish of the day) and it was delicious. Tried the venison and quail. They're supposed to cook the venison medium rare and most of my pieces came out rare rare as in the animal was about to run off my plate. Our server Suggested we put it back on the grill and cook it a bit more? ? It was so late by the time we got our food I said no and she made it right and took it off our bill.

"We always try to do a ""nice/ dress up"" dinner when we travel.We were also celebrating one of my friend's birthdays so we wanted something special.Researched a bit and one of my friends found Eberly.  Made reservations and about a week before called to see if they could do something for the birthday girl - absolutely they replied.  Sweet!  We are set!Friday night, we walked in and our jaws drop.  This restaurant is beautiful.They treat it almost as a museum.  As soon as you sit down and waters are served they give you a little bit of history of the place (also written on the back of their menus).This used to be an old print shop and they didn't change much of it.  They even have a space called ""The Study"" where you can dine.At the end of your meal, or at the bar, tabs are presented inside old books.  Nice/ cute touch.You are welcomed to tour the place, at any point, in fact they encourage you to do so.The main dining area is open space, with a ""vintage"" looking bar at the end.Dim lighting, makes this a great date spot.Menu has something for everyone, steak, chicken, fish.  I wanted something different so I decided on the Venison and Quail - Axis venison, iberico bacon, grilled quail, huckleberry preserves, pickled cabbage.  Venison was incredibly tender, juicy, it was almost like butter.  I was a bit scared of it being ""under-cooked"" to my taste but it was perfect.  Quail was so flavorful.  This dish was fantastic.As a side we ordered the Mac N Cheese to share.  Delicious by itself and loved it when paired with my dish.For dessert we ordered the  Natalie's basque cake - almond pastry, vanilla bean pastry cream,  poached pears, honeycomb, almonds, Manchego cheese ice cream.This dessert is exceptional.  The cake is not too sweet, the almond flavor fully comes out, the honeycomb and almonds area a nice sweet crunchy add to it, and that Manchego ice cream, please let me know where to get it - I could have scoops of that on its own, but paired with the almond flavor of the cake was just heavenly.As I mentioned we were celebrating my friend's birthday so they added a candle to the cake and wished her a happy birthday and all of us a wonderful stay in Austin.Service here was flawless, just as their food and ambiance.Absolutely loved this restaurant.  5 Gold stars!",5.0 star rating

There's complementary valet, but the man doing the valet wouldn't even approach the car when we arrived. I had to get out to speak with him. It's almost as if he didn't want to valet the car, because we asked what the parking situation was (bc the lot was full). He points down the street and says we can go park down there.

Fast forward..the meal was delicious as we ordered a steak for two that was perfectly prepared and topped with a mustard sauce along with sides of mushrooms and other vegetables. The Bacio was a delicious bourbon based cocktail that used a very refreshing shrub mixer. So good in fact that this was my drink the entire night as I closed out the trifecta!Highly recommended and will be making a return visit in the near future",5.0 star rating
You can't beat the ambiance. The food and drinks are great too! They have a back bar/lounge which you can hang out at before/after dinner. Great for a date night.,4.0 star rating
"Eberly delivered a great donning experience from the moment we walked in, the atom sphere was great with a lot of natural light and plants. The mood wasn't too serious as the decorations of books and other accessories showed. The food was creative and exceptional, from the first bite of their bread, to the last bite of the key lime pie, this restaurant amazed me with the attention to detail",5.0 star rating
"I give three stars only because our server was not very good.  The rest of our experience was wonderful!  But at a restaurant with such ambiance, good food, and well, a lot of hype - it's a buzz kill when your server seems annoyed AND forgets your app and your glass of wine.  I got the scallops, which were amazing!  We'll go back for another try.",3.0 star rating
"Rolled in one Monday evening for a meal.  Valet parking is crucial.  The place was half filled which was nice. Even at half filled, it was on the loud side so I can see what some reviews are saying regarding noise level.Started off with a draft beer.  Nice local selection.  Then moved on to a monte carlo cocktail.  Not a bad choice.  Sadly, no large ice cubes here.Appetizer was the tuna tartare.  Fresh tuna.  Nice chunks.  Served with potato chips.  I should have ordered my own.Dinner was the halibut special.  Fish was nice and done to perfection.  Good stuff here.  Desert included Parmesan ice cream.  Odd concept but surprisingly tasty.  Good spot.",3.0 star rating
"Wow I am blown away with how tender the steak and chicken remoulade dish was. Brussel sprouts and broccolini were perfect sides. I had a drink- suit and Thai- their play on a mai Thai and it was delicious. Loved the bar, loved the crowd, and the servers were attentive. Highly recommend.",5.0 star rating
"Eberly was seriously beautiful, the entire place is just so perfectly designed. The food however, I ordered the Short Rib Smash, and I truly think there was maybe 2 small bites of meat broken up in entirety of the dish. That was really disappointing for the cost and all, it was mostly just potatoes and vegetables. It was however VERY tasty, but I'd make a point not to skimp on dishes like that. I really want to give this review a 4, but I just can't. I would definitely go there again to try dinner though.",3.0 star rating
"A taste of Italy! Fantastic! We had a: -spicy salami (forgot it's Italian name)...it was simple but delicious; very similar to a plain pepperoni pizza. Good choice for someone who wants a classic hearty pizza. -numero28 pizza (I believe this is what it was called)...it had speck (cured pork; similar to bacon), mushrooms (which I subbed for potatoes) and TRUFFLE CREAM which was heavenly. Probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had, which is crazy because I typically go for heavier deep dish style pies. This place has changed how I see thin traditional pizza. -hazelnut gelato; we both loved this. I eat a lot (too much) gelato and hazelnut is my go-to flavor. This is seriously the best I've ever had. -also worth noting, they have hoegaarden on tap! Service was incredible. Amanda was our server, and she was so polite and speedy. Even the water was amazing, which is crazy because Austin water is bleh. Also, the pizzas come out very fast; I think they are the kind that is speed cooked in a very hot oven. Do keep in mind, the pizzas are not super heavy. We ate two 12 inch pizzas between the two of us and finished them all easily. Sharing a 12 inch probably wouldn't work unless you aren't very hungry (or tiny miniature people....)I cannot express how amazing this place is; you must try when in Austin!!!!!!",5.0 star rating
The mista tre colori salad is the BEST salad I've ever had! The ingredients are so fresh and the dressing is so light yet flavorful. The arancina vegetariana is delicious!

"We ordered a pizza for pickup. When we got there, no one helped us. Once someone stopped to help, they had no clue where the order was. It turns out they gave our order to someone else and didn't apologize or concerned for the inconvenience. They still charged full price after screwing up and making us wait around for another pizza.",1.0 star rating
"I have now been to this restaurant many times for many different occasions such as on a date or with friends after work.  First of all the drinks are very fairly priced, especially the wine.  Four glasses of wine is the same price as the bottle.  Secondly the pizza is awesome.  I think what sets this restaurant's pizza apart from other pizza joints is the freshness of their ingredients.  It may just be me, but the ingredients plus the pizza recipe makes one great pizza.  Also, I recommend putting the spicy olive oil on your pizza.  It adds a little kick.",5.0 star rating

"2.5 stars for me.  We walked in on a Friday evening around 7:15 and asked for a table of two.  The host seemed a bit confused by what to do with us considering there were a couple open 4 tops but no tables for 2, and after twiddling our thumbs for a few minutes, finally they gave us one of the tables by the window which is a great spot for people watching.  Service was slow, even though the food itself did not take that long to come out once we finally ordered.  It was a good 10-15 minutes after sitting down before anybody came by to ask if we wanted a drink, or were ready to order and I made eye contact with a couple different waiters, none of whom took the hint to ask if we needed something.Once a server did arrive though, he was friendly and helpful with questions.   We started off with the caponata con crostini, which was pretty flavorful and a decent size portion.  It became a bit sweet after eating almost the entire serving by myself, however.  Howe'ver I was incredibly disappointed by the lasagna considering the rave reviews of the dish.  The lasagna noodles were just gummy overcooked layers of dough with almost nothing whatsoever between the layers minus the absolute faintest smear of meat sauce sitting atop a quickly thickening bechamel sauce.  It tasted as if it were somebody's leftovers and didn't have a fresh quality to it, and was completely noodle heavy with no other substance or flavor, no significant sauce or meat, and the noodles themselves weren't even enjoyable.  I left half of the dish, and when nobody bothered to ask how our meal was, I didn't bother to mention that it was possibly the worst lasagna I've ever had, which sadly isn't a very long list and includes Stouffer's.  The saving grace to this spot, other than its great location is that they have Dolce Neve gelato  which is my favorite gelato in town.I seem to have had a pretty different experience than the majority of people here, but I can't say I'd recommend them based on our visit.",2.0 star rating
"We stopped by here late for a snack after going to an event at the Austin Music Hall. I thought this place has been there for a while but they are pretty new! I asked them and they had only been opened for about 5 months. Great place! I love the atmosphere. We got a beer and the taglieri option for 5. I didn't know much about it but the waitress was so helpful. We got the Cacciatorini, Speck and Mortadella. All delicious. My fave was the Speck and my husband likes the Cacciatorini. For cheeses, we went with Fontina and Provolone.I picked up some gelato on my way out. Their gelato is from Dolce Neve. :) Delicious. We will be back for lunch, their Cabuci options looks so yummy!",4.0 star rating
"We decided to dine here before seeing a show at the Moody theater. We actually had reservations somewhere else but as I stopped too snap a store front picture of Numero, one of their team members opened the door with a smile and kindly waved us in. After reading fellow Yelp friends' reviews along with a hospitable greeting I was sold.Numero 28 opened a couple of months ago yet still feels like a hidden gem. It's tucked away between the former How Do You Roll space and Malagas in the 2nd street district. The cute restaurant is small and intimate. This is the perfect spot for date night or to share pizzas with the family.We arrived at 7pm and found ample seating. We decided to sit at the bar to get a glimpse of the semi-open kitchen. This was a great decision as we got a great show from the chefs in action. We met Marco who is one of the partners at Numero 28. He was very hands on and worked along side the employees. Marco brought us out (and everyone else dining in at the bar) a taste of their garlic hummus, breads and evoo. The garlic hummus was delicious as was the soft fresh breads and quality evoo. I ordered and an Italian sauvignon blanc on tap and the  tonno scottato (seared yellowfin tuna) con couscous. Jesse ordered a Paroni, carpaccio and the arancina traditionale. For the price point I was surprised and happy with the portion size of the yellowfin tuna and the quality. I would say it was approximately 6-7 ounces of lightly seared tuna and it was perfectly seasoned. The carpaccio was slightly thicker compared to what I have been served other places (which I consider a good thing) and was topped with rucola, fresh Parmesan and evoo. The carpaccio had a hint of citrus which brightened the dish. The carpaccio is incredible and a must order! The arancina was served as one large ball (instead of mini ones you typically get). It is a saffron rice ball with Bolognese meat sauce, green peas mozzarella and served over a tomato sauce. The arancina was a bit bland in my opinion but everything else was excellent. We were full and decided to pass on dessert but Marco smiled and encouraged us to ""live a little"" and handed us two cannolis. The crunchy tube-shaped shells tasted like they had almond and were filled with a heavenly sweet cream ricotta. I would never had thought to order this on my own and I am sure glad I got to taste this traditional Italian i dolce.I am excited that they will soon have a small dog friendly patio at the front of the restaurant. They also have a few of my favorite things: happy hour, purse hooks and Dolce Neve gelato!",4.0 star rating

"We came here for an happy hour during our trip to Austin. What I can tell you... this is on of the place with the most authentic italian food and drinks you can find in US. So, if you get excited with a greasy pasta Alfredo please go elsewhere.Interestingly, people working there come from different regions of Italy so you will find a fusion of different regional influences. We had bresaola with ricotta.. which was delicious.. and frankly this was the first time I ever had a bresaola in US. The Arancini were to die for. And last but not least the drinks were so good... My wife got an Aperol-based Sprits and I got a mimosa...",5.0 star rating
"Our family visited Austin last weekend and wanted to eat dinner somewhere downtown to celebrate my sister in law's birthday. My brother in law found Numero 28, made a reservation for 9 people and we went. I know it is difficult to accommodate 9 people (3 were kids) at almost any restaurant, but Numero 28 was so considerate. They opened the bakery half of the restaurant just for us to sit in so we would be able to take our time and enjoy ourselves rather then feel rushed. I was a little worried we would be stuck in the back and forgotten about but our waitress, Ariana, made extra effort to personally attend to our needs. We were so spoiled! We ordered the meatballs, fried calamari, and the prosciutto and mozzarella for appetizers.... Amazing!! the meatballs were so tender and flavorful. I admit that I didn't try the calamari but the rest of the family loved it. The mozzarella  and prosciutto were melt in your mouth good! For our entrees we went family style and a split  two orders of lasagna and a couple of pizzas. The Margharita Pizza was fantastic,  as was the Diavlo. I did not try the Austin Pizza but other family members thought it was great as well. The lasagna was so good. Pasta was fresh the sauce was authentic. I could go for another plate of it right now! We rounded up our meal with Torta di Cioccolato, Panna Cotta, and Gelatos and left happy and stuffed! Cannot thank the folks at Numero 28 enough for an amazing meal and an awesome birthday celebration! Ariana, thank you for putting up with all of us, you made our night! We will be back next time we are in Austin!",5.0 star rating
Ordered 2 pizzas. 1 an 18 inch / the other a 29 inch as well as a caprese salad and meatball order. Arrived to pick up the order and was told they ran out of meatballs and the pizza order had 2 29 inch pizzas. The manager stated they tried calling me to tell me they ran out of meatballs. Received no such call- on top of that he tried charging me the 10 dollar difference for THEIR mistake on the pizza order and when I stated that was not acceptable he then offered to cut the difference in half or I'd have to wait for the correct pizza size to be made.  What a way to do business as apparently my time and satisfaction were not worth the 5.00 dollar difference in price.   Just an unbelievable experience and I would not recommend the restaurant simply because of the attitude exhibited by management.,1.0 star rating

"Authentic, delicious Italian in a smallish, shotgun-style setting.  The food was absolutely great, including some of the best lasagna I've ever eaten.  From their website:  ""We only select Italian ingredients which have obtained both the D.o.c. and the D.o.p. certification; In this way we offer our customers a genuine and traditional product woth of its fame.""  Our server told us that they make everything in house with ingredients imported from Italy, with the exception of the gelato.For the folks who like to say ""There's no 'real' Italian in Austin."", I recommend you give Numero 28 a try.  I've visited Italy twice and also grew up in a heavily-Italian area of the Northeast, and Italian food doesn't get more authentic than this.Two thumbs WAY UP for Numero 28.  We'll be spending time here for sure.",5.0 star rating
"The good: please don't leave this place without ordering the pizza! The red sauce is made to near perfection. Service was also spot on! The bad: I read a few reviews about how amazing the lasagna was so just HAD to try it. I was not too impressed. There was nothing different about it, just tasted like your every day lasagna. Overall I had a wonderful experience. I'm still craving their pizza, can't wait to go back for more!",4.0 star rating
"This was the best place to have a birthday feast-HANDS DOWN.  For me...I am a BIG wine-o from California.  And when I heard Numero 28 was serving some California wines, especially California wines on tap....I was sold!For my birthday dinner, we had originally thought appetizer, main course, wine and dessert.  But when we walked in and had our meal at the counter, we just decided to wing it!  The manager who was serving us was super friendly!  Gave us a great recommendation of ordering a California Cab (which was served on tap) and decided to pick two appetizers and share a pizza.Being a typically Greek-I am very picky on how my calamari is cooked.  But the calamari dish here was so traditional and so delicious-I am a huge fan of it and will recommend!  We also ordered the Polpette which are veal meatballs and those were also tasty too.  Lastly we couldn't figure out what pizza we wanted, so we were able to share a half of the Diavola (salami) and a half of the Rustica (sausage and peppers) and that was to die for.  And the finishing touch to dinner-in addition to the amazing wine-was there amazing Gelati.  Can someone tell me why the gelati is served in the smallest cup ever?  Its so good..I seriously want more.Overall-if you a big wine-o and you like the concept of wine on tap-please go here.  If you feel like winging it and wanting to share a couple appetizers and a pizza, I would still recommend Numero 28~",5.0 star rating

The food here is better than many places in Austin (IMO) including Maiko, Kyoto, Kenichi and Zushi Sushi.  The location is a bit off putting as it is lives in a strip center with a Mattress Firm and low rent haircut joint, but hey, maybe this contributes to the plentiful seating that I always experience.  For these reasons I tend to choose Umi over all other sushi establishments when venturing out for some raw goodness.",4.0 star rating

I have been coming to this place for about the last 8 years because it's one of my gotos for sushi. We went for dinner last night around 830 and it was great as usual! We were seated immediately and our server was Tiffany. This is how I base good service: Are they prompt in bringing whatever I ask for? Is my mouth ever left thirsty while I stare longingly at my empty water glass? Are their suggestions helpful? Do I have to hunt them down for my check? Tiffany passed my test perfectly. She was sweet and quick. Kept us updated on which food items would be on the way. She was absolutely perfect and I will forever ask for her. The sushi was awesome. WE had the yellow tail appetizer with jalapenos and stuff. Delicious! Next we had the baked scallop roll and the osaka roll ( something like that -  I'm pretty sure it's called something else). Both were given thumbs up from my boyfriend and he is soooo picky. We live south and this is a great place for us to pop in last minute with no wait. Yes the music is strangely loud but bf drummed along with his chopsticks which amused me. We will be back!,4.0 star rating
"When my husband and I walked in, I was first struck by the smell of incense.  It was very strong, and eventually gave me a headache.  The decor is also a bit dated, but that isn't very important to me.  And the music was a strange mix from the 90s and was pretty loud.Like others have stated, the staff was very nice.  However, our server was not that knowledgeable.  We asked what the gyoza was filled with, and after telling us they were filled with pork, she then went on to explain that they weren't ""noodle-y"" and that unlike other dumplings, they are fried.  That's fine, but not much of a surprise since gyoza are usually pan-fried or seared and then steamed.We were there during happy hour, so we ordered some of the sushi.  The rice was not seasoned at all and the grain looked too short for proper sushi rice.  If they were trying to pass another grain off for sushi rice, this might explain why it was dry and coming unrolled as our plate was put on the table.  The rolls lacked flavor and whatever soy sauce they put on the table is awful.I'm glad we got the sushi at the Happy Hour price, because I think I would have been sorely disappointed if I had paid full price for it.  For the price, I've had better sushi in Austin.",1.0 star rating

"Honestly, for me, about a 3 and a half star experience, and it doesn't fall on deaf ears that I came in here generally starved. It's a cute place (they were playing club music, that was interesting) ensconced in a strip mall off of I-35, and the menu seems both pretty affordable and reasonably thorough at once. We tried a number of different sashimi and sushi options, and I found the fatty tuna especially worthwhile. The sweet potato and asparagus tempura worked a few wonders of their own.  They have a nice selection of beers bottled and on tap, and a surprisingly adept wine list.  We didn't get around to trying the sake, but that may be on the agenda for next time.  Worth a little more exploring, certainly.",3.0 star rating

"The best way to try a lot of things on the menu is to take a hungry pregnant friend with you. Now, granted, said pregnant friend can't eat the raw stuff, but that's okay because all that fried stuf is really good, too. So is the Gyoza Soup.We got there around 6:30 and there was no wait. In fact, there were a lot of empty tables. It started to fill up as the night wore on.The waitress, although she begged to take our menus (we were ordering little by little and needed to keep them) even though the place was near empty, was still really helpful. She made suggestions and even a few anti-suggestions.We sat there for several hours, ordering nugget after delicious nugget of food. I even got my own spicy tuna roll. It was good. Kinda plain, but still good. The Seafood Yakitori was super yummy and the scallop on it was near perfect. Calamaris were some of the best I've ever had. We also had a few rolls (all cooked ones), and none of them were bad.When I say we ordered a lot of food, we ordered a lot of food.

"REVERSE HAPPY HOUR! I didn't actually try the food here, it looked like pretty basic sushi, but their reverse happy hour is awesome! Came around 10pm on a Friday night with a group of about 10 people and they were able to accommodate us. The Lychee Martini ($5) is definitely worth getting and was pretty strong! Service was good and did separate checks without us even asking which was nice.The ambience of Bar Chi is fairly trendy and was pretty lively on a Friday night. This place is great to grab a cocktail and some light food before going out (will have to try their food some day).",4.0 star rating
"There are few things that make me happier than happy hour & sushi so a few years ago when I found out that Bar Chi does a sushi reverse HH, I was thrilled!Since they take large party reservations at 10pm on a Friday or Saturday night, this has become the go-to for a big group wanting a light/cheap/good dinner downtown before hitting up the bars. They've even split checks for a big group of 18, unheard of at other restaurants!$2 sake bombs, $3-7 sushi rolls, $3-5 yakitori skewers, $5 martinis and pretty quick/friendly service - you can see why this has become such a reverse HH staple!Their large party policy is that 15 minutes from the reservation time, the entire party must be there so you can be seated (or they'll give your table away) plus a 20% gratuity charge - nothing out of the ordinary for a big group. EXCEPT, last night I was there with a group of 13 and after stellar service and all of our checks coming separate, giving our credit cards in a buzzed state & getting the receipt back to figure out how much extra tip to leave, she told us the 20% wasn't included. I KNOW that was false but everyone in the group was confused as to why she would tell us that after she already got 20%? Well, sketchiness - that's the answer. We ended up asking for itemized receipts & tip WAS in fact included so she was just trying to get double from us.... don't try to play a fast one on this girl!Anyway, that's the worst thing that's come out of bar chi & it happened last night after years of me going there - I'll definitely be back & make sure to double check my receipt before throwing my CC in next time!",4.0 star rating
"I came for lunch and ordered the Tofu Teppanyaki. The menu said it came with steamed rice, sauteed vegetables, and tofu. It was correct on only 1 out of the 3; the steamed rice. The rest of the food was completely inedible. The tofu was really more like a white jello, barely cooked, completely bland and tasteless. To say it comes with vegetables is even less accurate. The tofu was covered by carrots and peas that clearly came out of a can and also get served at the cafeteria of the local elementary school. I think they wanted to create such a spectacle of steam when serving it on the hot iron plate (picture fajitas at a mexican restaurant), that the food was drowning in a liquid mixture that was neither appetizing or visually appealing. The steamed rice was ok though. I've eaten here once before and the sushi was fine, not great but not bad.

"This is a brunch review.Live jazz band. Complimentary mimosas. Beautiful restaurant. And a really cool wine wall. The beginning of my brunch experience was very positive. Then the food came out. My Lavaca Omelet was laughably small. It could have fit in the palm of my hand. And while it tasted really good, I was still hungry afterwards.Still, when you figure in the free drinks, Trace isn't that bad. The food did taste really good, and the service was super friendly. If I did brunch here again, I would probably try the Quail and Waffles. I saw some children nearby eating it, and it made me jealous that they would leave full and satisfied.",3.0 star rating
"Great happy hour! My husband and I have now been during happy hour twice. We love to order several little dishes to share. We still end up spending $50+ after drinks and all those apps. I personally like the oyster shooters. He likes the lychee martini. The wings are only okay. Decent rolls. We had a California roll and one of the crunch rolls. I tried what I think is a new menu item, ceviche tostadas. They were very tasty and pretty to look at.My only complaint is that were charged for an extra drink that we didn't order. Our server told us we would not be charged for it and it was still on the bill. Won't stop us from coming back though.",4.0 star rating

I went on a Saturday night and they had a dj doing his thang, It was a liiiiiiiiiittle too loud for my earballs but hey, it was downtown Austin and I wasn't about to complain. Plus the music was actually good. Afterwards we made the hop skip and a jump to Gordoughs for dessert donuts and the rest is history.",5.0 star rating
"After much debate, I'm going to give this place 4 stars for one key reason: ambiance. I came here on a Tuesday for lunch because it offered the best combination in terms of a restaurant near the office serving a ARW lunch pre fixe. The menu was too intriguing to pass up.Pros: Like I said, the environment here is great. Beautiful interior, gorgeous singular WC units. I was lucky to get a table that was 'inside' but right by the open air seating so I got the best of both worlds in terms of air quality and sunlight. I also enjoyed a 'booth' which looked and felt more like a comfy little couch I had all to myself. Very robust cocktail, wine & food menu. Lots of really inspired combos to try. The banana pudding was absolutely DIVINE and came with one of the most beautiful desert preparations I have ever seen. The way the hush puppies were presented was super cool, too. The service was absolutely excellent, from the hostess to the server; I was well taken care of. For $42 I treated myself to a beautiful 3-course pre fixe w/fun cocktail.Cons: I struggled to give this place 4 stars because I was a bit disappointed by the food/drink I ordered. The drink, a cucumber/jalapeno lemonade was not spicy enough to include jalapeno in the title. The bright green color was over-the-top; there's nothing classy about neon green. The blue crab hush puppies... where was the blue crab? I didn't taste it. The sauce was good, but overall I tasted a lot of bread. I also found the braised lamb shoulder to be a bit oily; I could distinctly see a layer of oil on top of the sauce. It was surely tasty, but the oiliness is unforgiveable for a restaurant of this caliber.Despite the cons, I would definitely return to TRACE to try their other offerings (like the Drunken Doughnuts) and enjoy the beautiful scene. There's something very Miam about this place that feels like a breath of fresh air in a town that oft caters to hipsters. Recommend for girlfriends, client dinners or a date night. NOT necessarily for foodies.",4.0 star rating

"Ultimate empty nester Chrustmas dinner - out.Four courses.  I started with the lobster bisque - lobster flavor came through w/o being overpowered by the cream and butter.  DW had the frisée salad.  Next course, I had the foie gras and chestnut risotto, she had the lobster mac and cheese.  Both were great.  Mains - mine was turkey, hers prime rib.  Mine was so-so.  Turkey was moist, but thickly sliced from a roll.  Dressing cube was a solid chunk of puréed unappetizing starch.  The prince rib was solid, but the Yorkshire pudding muffins were dense vice airy.  Why bother if you are going for mediocrity?  Desserts - mine was milk and cookies - shortbread, nut cookie, and a warm chocolate ganache for sipping.  Hers was a pumpkin cake with cream cheese icing.  Both were good.For last minute, it was OK.  Next time will plan in advance and get into the Four Seasons buffet.  Have always considered Trio to be a much better restaurant than Trace, so would expect the same at major holidays.",3.0 star rating

"I recently ate at Trace while visiting Austin for hands down my best meal while there. I was looking for something downtown with nice atmosphere and a bit more upscale than the standard Austin fare of bbq and tacos. The W seemed like a safe bet and Trace definitely  delivered with great food décor, great food and excellent service.Our server was Ben who seemed to have all the qualities of a southern gentleman...very attentive and helpful in selecting items from the menu since a few of us were vegetarian. He seemed to know the the food and wine menu very well, and let us sample our wines to select properly. He was even great about giving us suggestions for things to do around town...It didn't hurt that he was super cute too :) Our food and drinks came promptly and we were all really happy with all the entrees suggested. Definitely going back next time I'm in town!!!",5.0 star rating
Always have issues with service and the food is hit or miss at best. Also the menu is super limited with only one or two non-red meat options. There are a number of good dishes but none that stand out as must haves. Their shrimp and grits is probably the best thing on the menu.,3.0 star rating
"I dined at Trace recently while I was in town for the ACL music festival. This is located in the W on 2nd street. The interior is gorgeous - sleek silver and rusty hues with a modern Hollywood Regency flair.We started with wine, the Market Snacks, and the Charcuterie Board. I ordered the Seared Loch Duart Salmon as my entree. The salmon was cooked perfectly - lightly grilled and extremely flavorful served atop roasted cauliflower, sweet and sour eggplant, with meyer lemon puree. The eggplant married well with the texture of the salmon however the harsh cauliflower threw it off a bit.The desert menu is so unique and not to be overlooked. If you splurge on one sweet treat this year, do it at Trace! We could not decide what to order, so we asked the waitress to bring us her favorite. She surprised us with two - the Creamsicle and the Drunken Doughnuts. They were both wonderful... The Creamsicle is a fried cupcake, served with orange ice cream, cucumber cilantro granita & strawberry meringue. This is worth trying for the Cucumber cilantro granita alone! The Drunken Doughnuts were equally fantastic! The sugared doughnut holes are served with 3 dipping options: vodka whipped cream, tequila chili fudge sauce & bourbon dulce de leche. Oh, the vodka whipped cream... delish!",4.0 star rating
"What we got: Appetizers: Agedashi tofu, calamari, baby octopus, scampi wrapped in bacon. Rolls: Shrimp crunch, Neemo, geisha. Good food, great happy hour, and a fun environment.

"So the first time I came here was after I saw Pat Benatar perform at the moody. Super walking distance so what the heck. I was sooo pleasantly surprised!! They had a Dj playing great dance music, the lighting was perfect, and I got drunk on reverse happy hour! We shut the place DOWN!! Super great prices and for those prices, I didn't pay on the toilet. Which is worth it's weight in gold for me when it comes to sushi!! The Nemo roll is my fave for sure!! I only come for happy hour, that's how I roll (haha) The Austin roll is a close runner up.

"I went with some friends during their happy hour on a Monday, before an ACL Live show.  It was beautiful weather, so we sat outside on their patio under pretty trees lit with strings of lights.  I guess we got there around 6pm, and were sat immediately. There were plenty of open tables, actually.  We ordered their cheese board and their charcuterie, and then every one of their small plates (except for the butternut soup and bibb salad).  Everything was delicious.  The standouts for me were the hamachi crudo, kale salad, and beef tartare.  My friends are oyster lovers, and they assured me the oysters were also extremely good. We tried the coconut basil panna cotta and butterscotch bourbon pudding for dessert.  The panna cotta was the only dish of the night I didn't really care for.  The butterscotch pudding, on the other hand, was amazing. We didn't really take advantage of their happy hour food menu, but did order off the hh drink menu. For the number of plates we sampled, and drinks ordered, the price wasn't too unreasonable.  I'll definitely be back for dinner next time I see a show at the Moody Theater.ps - bonus, they brought out $100 in giftcards to our table after learning we were locals!  Score!",4.0 star rating
"I came here on Thanksgiving Day. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. The decor and the patio is very nice. I enjoyed people watching and the maitre' d was friendly. He informed us that both the bee keeper and his bees as well as the forager were no longer at the W. Thus dashing my hopes of visiting the bees on the roof and having a freshly foraged salad.I ordered a  salad anyway. It was supposed to have arugula, endive, and blue cheese in it. The salad tasted so so--No endive and very little blue cheese. Also the arugula tasted more like lettuce rather than having the strong meaty taste of the arugula that I'm accustomed to eating.  My main dish was the poached steak. It tasted like turkey and was luke warm. Too much sage? Or did it absorb turkey taste from nearby turkey during re-heating? I don't  know. I was surprised to have a turkey tasting steak. My companion insisted that I send it back. So I did. In its place, I ordered the vanilla infused beef rib. This was better and the plate was warmer. It didn't taste like turkey but it didn't have much taste either. My companion had the wild salmon. She thought it tasted salty but OK. Dessert was good. I had a mousse type of dessert. Service was fine. We did not feel rushed. However, I looked behind me as our waitress was serving another table. The couple was still eating their appetizers when she tried to serve them their main courses. She stood beside the table for awhile waiting for them to move aside their appetizers, but they did not do so, and I saw her retreat to the kitchen while rolling her eyes. This is an expensive restaurant  and most diners do not expect to be rushed. There were no people in line waiting for tables. So, there  was no excuse for her behavior.",2.0 star rating
"I want to start this to say that we only went to the bar for Happy Hour but what we had was a joy ... The drinks were spectacular and you could tell the bartender was really taking his job seriously versus a dude slinging booze to idiots. He actually talked about drinks and made recommendations to us. We had the Lemongrass Drop and the Pomegranate Sling and both were tasty. For food we had the Charcuterie and Fromage which was fantastic (it was funny because it turned out our favorite cheese was the simple blue) and we also had the coconut mussels. I try the mussels everyplace I go and I'd have to say these were the best!  The ambiance is great for a fine dining establishment and from what we saw of the dining area, it was the same if not better there. I wish we could have eaten dinner there.",5.0 star rating
"BarChi has been on my must try sushi list for a couple months now and finally decided to go last night.  They have a great happy hour that I would love to share when but the website, menu and sign out front all have conflicting on the hours.  One thing is certain that they have happy hour all day on Sundays.The happy hour menu is pretty big and has sushi, maki rolls, appetizers, and robata skewers. They also offer some killer drink specials like $1.50 sake bombs, $4 martinis and cosmos, $4 house wine and beer ranging from $2.25-3.50.  The real treat is the house made infused sakes running $7 during happy hour.  I am not a sweet drink fan but the bartender offered me a tasting of pineapple sake and it was really yummy.  They also have a sake bloody Mary with jalapeno infused sake (probably goes great on that all day Happy Hour on Sunday).I ordered the Austin roll and a piece of what they referred to ""super white tuna"" (aka escolar) nigiri.  The Austin roll consists of tuna, escolar, salmon, tomago, avocado and just a little spicy mayonnaise. I really liked the Austin roll which they are fairly generous with the amount of fish in the roll. The escolar was not the best I have ever had but was also good.BarChi has a comfortable atmosphere and various seating options from the bar, lounge, restaurant and very large sushi bar. With such a great happy hour and good location by 2nd street, I kept asking myself where everyone is at.  I was one of four customers in the restaurant the entire time I was there.",4.0 star rating

"Happy hour on Sunday night? Yes! The restaurant was fairly quiet when we were there but this may be due to the fact that most people were still at ACL. There are many seating options to choose from, from sitting at a table to a booth or to a bar. The server was fairly quick in getting to our table and taking our order but it did take 15-20 minutes for him to get our checks after we were done eating, probably because there weren't many waiters on staff. The sushi itself is reasonably priced and the portion size was just right. You can't go wrong by ordering their vegetable tempura or sashimi.",3.0 star rating

"This review is for their all day happy hour on Sunday! We had to find a place to kill time for 2 hours before our flight and after checking out of our Airbnb and found this happy hour through Yelp. After a long weekend of drinking we only came here for the food. Being from San Francisco, we weren't sure if Austin would have good sushi compared to what we are used to. Boy, we were wrong.All nigiri, apps and rolls were pretty cheap - I love a good deal!Austin roll ($7) HIGHLY recommend if you love a variety of sashimi and want a fresh, tasty roll. Salmon & yellow tail nigiri: $1.80 a piece, very fresh and delicious. Calamari: as you'd expect, not amazing, not terrible.Service was normal and restaurant itself had great outdoor seating. Not sure why the ratings aren't higher here. Would come back next time I'm in Austin, especially for their happy hour.",5.0 star rating
I love the sushi here vs the price during happy hour! So perfect!!!I always get the Austin roll and definitely the agedashi tofu. This place has the best agedashi tofu that I've had!

"THEY EVEN BROUGHT ME CHAPSTICK!I made reservations for 7pm the night before the F1 race, several weeks in advance, and good thing for that because TRACE was packed!  But it did not disappoint!  Once again, TRACE continues to impress me with its food, ambience, and service.I continue to scratch my head at some of the mediocre reviews I see here because all 4 experiences I have had here have been incredible.  I am convinced that many of the reviewers are not often eating at Congress, Olivia, Restaurant Jezebel (the former and future), and the like and so really don't have a good comparison both for quality and for price. Our server, Micah, was extremely attentive and honestly it is very difficult to find servers with extensive knowledge of not only the wine list, but the cheeses on the menu as well as the peatiness of the various scotches on the menu.  Micah loves the food and really believes in what he is serving, and it shows big time.  Micah even went out of his way to summon a lip gloss from the spa when I complained that my lips were chapped.  As my wife posted on facebook during our dinner, and I will paraphrase: ""I learned that Phil will ask for anything at a restaurant, including chapstick.  I also learned at a restaurant at the W will actually bring it to you.""This experience, along with his prompt delivery of palette-cleansing grilled bread when I switched drinks, was a perfect example of his high energy and commitment to our enjoyment throughout the evening.The food was excellent -- the crab cakes were among the best I had -- lump style but with a flavor and creaminess almost reminiscent of a Maryland style crab cake.  The cheese, charcuterie, sides, entrees, etc. all excellent.  I've not really had anything bad here yet.Closing out the evening I asked Micah what the many europeans in town were requesting in the way of drinks.  He recommended an expresso paired with a shot of lemon twist, which I eagerly agreed to... alternately sipping each led to a really unique experience not often found on this side of the pond.If you are looking for a hip joint where you sit outside waiting for 2 hours for good food (Barley Swine, Foreign & Domestic, Justine's - all of which I love) then by all means do that.  But if you want an evening (where you can actually secure a reservation) of good food, wine, champagne, mixed drinks, coffees, and yes even scotch with friends, then TRACE is your place.The entire experience lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes -- and yet we never waited long for anything.  We just ate a lot!  We shouldn't couldn't stop enjoying the great food and drinks!Thank you TRACE!  I have to be one of your biggest fans...",5.0 star rating

"I heart fancy hotels.  I heart fancy food.  TRACE at the W combines both of these things, along with a penchant for writing in capital letters.  But if I'm being really honest with you (and myself), my feelings for TRACE are only half-hearted.  Let me explain:The patio is super-pleasant, enclosed, and shaded - yes!The brunch menu is well-priced and offers variety - yes!The first mimosa or bloody mary is free and they are $3 thereafter - genius!!BUT ...   The service leaves a little something to be desired ... My friend who joined me for brunch summed it up really well - at a hotel like the W, you expect a high degree of service.  She had a point - we only got a medium-rare amount of service.  It was little things: a frazzled hostess (even though they just opened and the restaurant was virtually empty), a stack of dishes that piled up on our small table (they picked them up when we brought them to the attention of the servers), asking if we were ready for the check instead of asking if we wanted anything else (which we did).  I want to be clear: this was not a case of egregiously-bad service.  The service was FINE, but it was *only* fine, not great.  Why am I holding TRACE to this standard?  Because fancy hotels distinguish themselves through good (or even great) service.  So, I expect fancy hotel restaurants to meet or exceed the good service standard.  I'm not saying I need you to fold up my napkin every time I get up from the table, but I don't want to have to hold up my pile of dishes in order to get someone to remove them.  All of this being said,  I would definitely go back if someone invited me.  They've got a lot of good things going: a nice patio, delicious food options, and the first drink free during brunch.  What would take TRACE to the next level and make me want to go (of my own volition) is if they would be a little more proactive and just knock some of the rough edges off of the service.",3.0 star rating
I think the location is great. They're open late so it's close by to get a late night bite after drinking. For Saturday night the BF and I were quickly seated. They played music... wish it was better. Our waitress was friendly and service was no doubt an issue that night.We ordered the agedashi tofu to start off. $4 for 4 pieces on the regular dinner menu was very reasonably priced! Then we ordered the volcano and Fahrenheit rolls. The sushi was fresh and beautifully presented. But it wasn't out of this world though. What struck me was that when I asked for a side of spicy mayo... the food runner said it would cost an additional $1. WHAT?! I have never been charged for any extra sauces before... I still ordered it but I thought the charge was pretty silly. The lychee martini wasn't bad but I've had much better. Overall I wouldn't drive out for this place and will only pop in again if I'm in the area.,3.0 star rating
"Good food (sashimi with lemon sauce appetizer was yummy). Nice ambiance. Weather permitting, their outside seating is preferable to the inside. Service was courteous but on the slow side. Considering, it was not overly busy, I found it odd for such an upscale place. It is a bit of a meandering endeavor to find the restaurant area from the lobby. If not for my dinner companion, who has been there before, I would've needed a treasure map to locate this place (and that's on foot -- and sober). Overall, I would probably return, but I would need a good occasion to do so. P.S. Drunken Donuts are good -- especially with the butterscotch sauce and a latte.",4.0 star rating

"A local while staying at a hotel around the corner said I needed to visit Downtown Jo's as it was the hip place to visit for a coffee and breakfast snack. What do they say when in Rome, do as the Romans do? Figured I would give it a shot, and I will forewarn you I do tend to be a tad picky on coffee, so I was prepped and ready to be blown away judging from the locals review of the coffee shop.Upon arriving, I noticed quite a long queue, I may of hit the morning commuter crew, so I had high hopes at this point. Once I got to the register, ordered a croissant, potato taco, and a black coffee (No judging of my weird order please, hah). Prices were on par for what one would pay at a typical coffee shop in SF or Seattle or any other major city. After what felt like an hour, yes an exaggeration, more of a 15 minute wait, I grabbed my order and found a table nearby. First off, croissant was a disappointment, felt like it had been sitting out for a day as it was quite stale. The taco on the other hand was quite delicious and to pull off a potato based taco with a unique flavor and not be dry was quite impressive. Now the finale of the coffee, arabica based coffee from Kenya, I was so excited only to find out it was lukewarm! Due to the long line and the staff working their tails off to make everyone happy I decided not to ask for another and enjoyed the one I had. Hard to tell if was stellar as lukewarm coffee really does not present its peak taste compared to the piping hot coffee you normally get, but it was not too bad.Would I come back, its a possibility, but was not too impressed honestly.",3.0 star rating

"I have ALWAYS been a fan of Jo's Coffee, not just the establishment but their actual coffee. I've been going to its original location on Congress close to 18 years and have never been disappointed with their fare. The downtown location is just as good but it is an indoor restaurant with a full menu. The breakfast tacos are great and delicious, but I really come here for the coffee. It has a very unique taste due to its roasting standards, and although the roasters have changed the flavor is still the same.

It took over 45 minutes from the time we ordered to get a simple chicken sandwich and onion rings. Food is pretty great here but service has been a disappointment nearly every time I come (over 3 years regularly). This time was just so bad I had to say something. (I was given 2 cards for a complimentary drink for my trouble, not near the hour I wasted or the $16 order I placed, but the gesture was appreciated if not completely equal).",1.0 star rating
"After driving from Houston to go to city hall for a speak out rally, with not much time to spare, we settled on eating here. Not to mention, it was super cute and drew me in. My friend settled on the melted ham and swiss, I had the Jo's hamburger with cheese and my daughter had the mushroom patty melt. All were served with fresh cut fries but were served cold. We really enjoyed the sandwiches. The bun on my burger was soft and had a hint of sweetness to it. The service was great and I really wish I could remember the man at the register's name. He was very pleasant and quite delightful.",4.0 star rating
Hot Chai Tea Latte: YES!! Get This if this is your normal drink. I think you have to be someone that likes that cinnamon flavor to like it in the first place. This was really really really good in my opinion. Fried avocado burger: meh... I had to force myself to finish it. I don't like to waste food. But my friend who I split it with said it was one of the best she's ever had because the bun was sweet. So... my review for this is ambivalent.,5.0 star rating
So glad we found this local chain while in Austin for a long weekend. We came here every morning and it was always packed. Walking in we were a bit confused as to which line to stand in and whether to order at the outside window or inside at the counter. The lines moved very fast though the and service was super friendly. She warned us that the Turbo Iced Coffee was very sweet and suggested we tried the Belgium Bomber Iced Coffee instead which is a 1/2 Turbo mixed with their Cold Brew. IT was AMAZING!!!! I highly recommend this on a warm fall day walking around the city.I wish they would open one in DC!,4.0 star rating
It's more than just a coffee shop. I fully expected that the breakfast menu would simply be a few pastries but it's so much more. My husband and I had excellent breakfast tacos while my daughter had chocolate chip pancakes   The coffee has a wonderful robust flavor and Jo's offers many dairy and non dairy options including almond and coconut milk. We will definitely go back.,5.0 star rating
"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars!  The food was amazing, a lot of flavor. I had the migas and fried avocado tacos, both delicious and accompanied by tasty salsas. My husband had the spicy bacon sandwich, SO good. They should make all their sandwiches on those sweet rolls!  We split the Belgian bomber which is an iced coffee drink, a lot of flavor but not too sweet. The guy at the counter was super friendly and provided spot on recommendations. Neat atmosphere, modern with lots of seating compared to other coffee shops.",5.0 star rating
"To be honest not that great. Have been to the Dallas one a couple of times and that was ok, but now I'm thinking it must mainly have been the location and space. Had pizza and a pasta in our group. Pizza might have been ok 5 years ago but today when so many other options around it is not good enough. No tap beers which seems strange for Austin. Pasta had a strange taste to it. A wasted meal in Austin.",3.0 star rating
Taverna has recently raised their prices all around. Gone are the days of $1 mimosas - they're now $2 and our favorite menu items have also gone up by at least $2. This last time going there the food  quality has gone down. We ordered the crab cake eggs benedict and it was really so so and the breakfast potatoes were very salty. I'm sad to say that my brunch days may be numbered at this location. It's really too bad but $17 is way too much for truffle risotto and the $1 mimosas and belinis were what drew my attention.,3.0 star rating

"Go for the drinks! This cozy restaurant/bar is has a wonderful staff, decent food with an Italian flare. They offer a wide variety of antipasti prior to the meal with delicious mustards, smoked meats, artichokes, and asparagus. They were all amazing, and when match with the ample selection of drinks offered at the bar, it was an excellent pairing. The bartenders are quite knowledgeable, offering a variety of quality scotches. They also know their whiskeys, bourbons, and wines. In fact, the whole staff is quite knowledgeable about the food and drink pairings. Our waitress was fantastic, and we really enjoyed her recommendations and explanations of the food. The restaurant consists of a large bar, a restaurant seating area, and a kitchen with a copper Italian oven that you normally cook things like pizzas on. The oven runs on gas.  The meal consisted of a surf & turf with a beef cut (loin?) that was absolutely delicious and tender. It was paired with a mushroom and red wine sauce that was fantastic! The fish was a white fish that wasn't anything to write home about. It seemed overcooked. I hardly touched the fish. I found the location to be clean, and well lit. It accommodates small parties to large groups! I enjoyed the food, and would certainly return.",4.0 star rating
"Taverna was one of the first restaurants I visited in downtown Austin, and I still have a bit of nostalgic love from the first time I had dinner there.My first time there the waiter mixed up my order, and I ended up with the fiocchi al gorgonzola e pera (gorgonzola & pear filled pasta with walnuts, arugula & dolce latte cream sauce). This was probably the best mistake the waiter could have made. I have never had fruit-filled pasta before, and I was worried the novelty would make the dish less enjoyable. It turned out I did not need to worry! The sweetness of the dish was not overpowering at all against the sharpness of the gorgonzola, even if it was an odd flavor for an entree.As for the service, the waiter did mix up my order. He was lucky the mistake turned out to be such a fortunate one for me! The wait time was long enough to be noticeable, but with good company it should not be a problem. The ambience is nothing really special, but it is not off-putting or unpleasant.",4.0 star rating
"3.5 stars --- rounding up to 4.BRUNCH! the best time of the week, the last bastion of sunshine before another grueling workweek...choose wisely, it is a whole 7 days until you can have another round of mimosas in your hand.After a pretty rowdy night out, we headed down to Taverna for brunch. Yes, the wait was long, but they had hangover friendly couches! We had the dollar mimosas, and they were okay. My taverna hash was alright, and the food was an overall 3 stars.Service good, atmosphere good, would brunch here again if only for the location and atmosphere, but the food is nothing to write home about. Noted for the cuteness, may have to come back and give it another chance.",4.0 star rating
"I love Taverna's dinner, and their brunch is nice too. I think the dinner food is a cut above the brunch food - their risotto is delicious and the wine list is strong. The indoor atmosphere is great for dates and the patio is a bit more casual. The only downside is the difficulty parking downtown, but that's to be expected I guess. I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered here!",4.0 star rating
"This is MY FAVORITE brunch place in Austin. And brunch is my favorite meal! So this place holds a very special place in my heart. Also mimosas and bellinis under $2! And good tasting ones at that!I have always come here with someone and I am always able to convince that someone to get something different than me so that we can share two meals. I'm a lucky girl. There are always a lot of people here for brunch, but I still don't ever have to really wait that long.My absolute favorite combo is the Classic Eggs Benedict with crabmeat and the Vanilla French Toast.I've gone once for happy hour and that was great too. A good place to pass the time if you are going to a concert nearby at the ACL Moody Theater or are waiting out traffic.It has been and still is one of my favorite places in Austin!",5.0 star rating
"Not bad, not bad at all.  I've only been once, for happy hour, but sat at the bar (happy hour is only in the bar and lounge area) and had fantastic service.  Tuesday nights they have half price bottles but the $2 happy hour mimosas/peach bellinis, $4 house wine, $6 premium wine, were a better deal when you don't have enough wine drinkers in the group to split a bottle.The happy hour food menu is a pretty good deal - I had the Gorgonzola/pear/arugula pizza.  It surprised me by having strips of prosciutto on top as well (so beware Vegetarians).  The crust is REALLY good...I have a severe dislike for crust usually, but this had a lot of flavor and crunch to it.Typical crappy domestic/import beer selection (bud light, miller light, dos equis, modelo?, etc), but did have Shiner Bock and St. Arnold's seasonal (Christmas Ale) for the snobby.",4.0 star rating

"Where to begin I guess first Ill start out by saying RUDE. Seated by a girl named Alice or Anice or something similar and maybe it was my clothing but just got a rude vibe. Im more of an ed hardy guy not like rude H&M. My man Vin and I had a pretty rad time, good food better drinks. We asked if we could get a reservation from a gentleman named Ronny or Pauly I think as we had a large party coming in a few days later and you guessed it, RUDE.  They said no reservations during brunch. I hope to get better service next time for my girls Sammy and Deena in town. I expect better from a lombardi restaraunt as the one in Dallas is way better. I will leave a review for Dallas Taverna now and how great and non rude Elvay was. As for Taverna Austin more like TaRUDEa.

"BRUNCH REVIEW:$1 mimosas and bellinis keep me coming back, over & over & over again. The wait is always stupid long if you arrive after 11am on a Saturday or Sunday but brunch extends from 9am - 3pm which is great. You can drink while you wait in front of the restaurant for your table which makes for some extra fun people watching. The brunch fare here is pretty good, they've got plenty of options from a basic plate of eggs w/ bacon, sausage or potatoes to some exciting fritatas and a breakfast pizza! I'd recommend checking out the specials on the chalk board, those are normally what I order for brunch and they're pretty darn tasty. My favorite is probably the breakfast pizza or the smoked barbecue hash. Throw a fried egg cooked correctly on anything and give me a mimosa and I'm happy. If you drizzle some truffle oil on that fried egg, I'm extra happy! I can't really comment on the service because I know the staff is trying to get people in & out of there at brunch, the past few times that I have been around noon, they have brought us the check before clearing our plates & asking if we would like a last round of drinks or anything else. I don't like being rushed, especially if I just waited almost an hour to eat! I've only been to a meal there once other than dinner but have been to brunch plentyyyy of times so I can't comment on their actual food. The only thing that I wish they did was take reservations on Saturday or Sunday brunch, that would make me a whole lot happier. But I guess they'd lose out on the drink revenue they're making while people wait for tables.",4.0 star rating
"Taverna used to be our favorite brunch spot but I don't know that we will be going back any time soon.  For one, they are known for their frozen bellinis but we were told they are now discontinued.  Also after we finished our meal, we were asked to leave so they could have our table for others coming in...incredibly rude after our party of 4 had spent quite a lot with them and where finishing our time together to catch up.",1.0 star rating
"$1 mimosa who can argue? The food was great and came out quickly. The waitress was funny, she kept telling us to finish our drinks so she can get us a refill stat, I don't know if it's a tactic to ring up our bill but it was worth it to us  anyway if you decide to eat and drink here for brunch get there early before it get packed and it gets packed quick!",5.0 star rating
"I went for Happy Hour on Sunday where you can get $1 mimosas and belinnis. The wait is around an hour, but seating goes by quickly so I ended up shopping around the area for 30 minutes. They let you order the drinks at the bar while you wait for seating, so that kept me and my sister busy. Space: The place is a little cramped. You can either sit outside or inside. We were place in the middle of the room so we had a little more room than other. Service: The waiter was okay. He read off the special menu of the ingredient, so it really didnt help me make a choice on the food item. Food: I honestly think the food is okay for brunch. I have been here for dinner and I honestly preferred that menu over the brunch menu. I got the Crab Cake Benedict, my sister got the Fritatta, and her BF got the Breakfast Calzone. We wanted to try the Chicken and Waffles, but it ran out so Im guessing that is a super popular item.  Overall, I would give the food a 3.5 and then the drink special bumps it up to a four star.",4.0 star rating

"Had a very forgettable experience here on a Friday night. Firstly, the waiter lacked personality and wasn't very cordial. Whatever happened to good customer service? Oh wait that's right this is Austin.We ordered a few appetizers, and when the guacamole came out I thought it was a mistaken side guac that was delivered. I'm not sure why they charged $12 for a half avocado. I mean what's up with the tiny portions? We then ordered all of the entrées, which were brought to us within a few minutes of each other for staging purposes. Portions very small, but the food was decent. It was obvious that the waiter had forgotten to put in the chicken so I reminded him as we were finishing the entrées, and then 30 minutes go by and still no chicken. I reminded him once more, and he said well he wanted to put it that order later so everything was spaced out. He basically lied to our faces, as it was apparent that he simply forgot to put the order in. Another 10 minutes go by and no chicken. One of our party members was saving their appetite for this chicken, and when he came by again with no chicken I told him to just cancel it. He wasn't apologetic, he just looked baffled and unemotional.It was an awkward and forgettable situation - the only reason I will go back to this place would be to have drinks at the bar.",2.0 star rating
"I went there for a work dinner last week and let me say that the waitress was amazing. She was kind, quick and had wonderful suggestions. Here's why I'm not a fan.  We were told that it is a 'family-style' menu and the dishes aren't really designed to be entree's. The problem for me was that there was not really enough of the dish to go around. There were 5 of us, and one dish equaled about 1 bite person. So it felt like I was just tasting the possibility of dinner. The prices for these a la carte dishes are pretty expensive. It's really more of a tapas bar (not that I have anything against tapas bars), it just wasn't enough to satisfy or to give me an adequate representation of the dishes we ordered.We had the following: Guacamole tasting- This was good, I enjoyed one with the chipotle puree the most. Mixta Salad- This was good, nothing spectacular, the vinaigrette was tasty.Hamachi- I didn't have this, it only was enough for 3 of 5 in our group so I opted out.Tostadas de Atun- This was surprisingly good. It looks like a slice of tuna on a tostada chip, which wasn't exactly visually appealing to me, but it was a good mix of flavors. We got to have 1 chip each.Mole Dominguero- This was one of the ones I liked most. The chicken had really good flavor. But could not taste the mole whatsoever. Chile Relleno- This was my favorite. There wasn't enough of the pepper, it also served about 3 of 5. The others that tried it didn't like the mornay, but I really enjoyed it. It was very rich.Bistec Asado- This was good, we each got one bite, I really wished there was more. It was a wonderful flavor. Queso Flameado- This was good, a skillet with cheese and corn tortillas on the side. We each were able to get one tortilla about half filled with cheese. Also something I wished there was more of, as it was very tasty. We had dessert also:Dulce de leche- Absolutely wonderful dessert. Boca Negra- This was amazing simply because of the banana ice cream and the way it offset the spice in the cake. The cake on its own was overwhelmingly spicy and I could not taste the chocolate after a couple of bites because my taste buds were more focused on the spice. Drinks: Margarita de Condesa- It was good. Great happy hour price of $6. Could not taste the tequila, but it had a lot of flavor and did not taste like a basic margarita. The cactus-lemongrass salt was different but good.El Cubico- This was my other drink. The volcanic saffron was something I had to try. The whole drink in and of itself was different, but really good. I can't say I would try it again, but for a shot in the dark at something new, it was good.So, as you can see we really really did try a lot of options. I didn't leave full, in fact an hour or so later I kind of wanted a snack. The food was good based on what I tasted, nothing knock my socks of good. I also can't say I would put the restaurant at the top of my 'must go to again"" list, but it was a pleasant evening and a food adventure for sure.",3.0 star rating
The Masas and bistec asado were quite tasty. It is severely over priced but the food was solid and a cool experience. The Gaucamole sampler was a bit underwhelming...way too many chips and a small amount of gauc...usually the ratio is the opposite but it is a bit annoying.

I'm from California so maybe I have different ideas about Mexican food and tapas. The food was mediocre and pricy. The waiter didn't bother to explain any of the menu so my friend ordering a ""tostada"" got a small something that was 3"" in diameter - definitely not a dinner for a hungry guy. Then the waiter made a mess opening the wine which he didn't clean up. One of the kids in our party ordered a chicken quesadilla and they couldn't get that right.

"I've been to Condesa for a grad party (in their private room - check that ish out) and I thought it was gorgeous, so I decided to come back for a Sunday brunch. Now Condesa - like everyone has stated below - is beautiful. The food is pretty good, but holy hell you want to charge me $12 for one avocado worth of guac? Not even kidding about that. The waitress saw my face and asked if I would like her to take the bowl (let's be real - it was maybe the size of my hand when cupped) and I actually said yes. To be clear, I have no problem throwing down for food but this guac situation was just offensive. The mimosas were $2 though, so that reinvigorated my soul. Then the mimosas came and I pulled an Amy Schumer and asked if they could hold back a teensy bit on the OJ because they had really OJ'd it down. They also don't do carafes for whatever reason, no biggie for me, and there are no real brunch specials aside of the $2 mimosas which was a bit of a bummer. They did have salsa and chips, but they don't do salsa refills and they come in very small little tin cup things. Basically. I'm ALL about paying for good food and I would definitely consider them for a private party because they have a beautiful underground little room that they rent out, but they are stingyyyyyy on the specials. Now I would be curious to try their HH because it's apparently half off from 5-7PM and their drink combos do look great, but it is *only* at the bar which is a little small so you'll need to snag a spot early.",3.0 star rating

The manager even came out and was rude and not helpful. I asked to have my meat cooked well done on my taco and my waitress said it only comes out rare.

"If Numero28 were in a city with no other pizza or Italian options, I would give it a higher rating. Unfortunately, this place just isn't up to par with your other options. Pair the lackluster food with having to pay for parking and it's just not worth it at all. ExperienceThey make an attempt at being hospitable, but we only got bread when we asked for it. We were told that they only bring it when you ask, but ""it's really good"" (it wasn't good). My table joked about whether we have to ask for some oil and pepper too. We never did ask, but after checking Yelp, I noticed that they in fact do have oil, but it was never brought out to us! What the hell man?! The service was awkward. That's the only way I can describe it. It just felt unhelpfully weird. I was so ready to leave by the end of the meal. The tables are really cramped because this place is tiny. A pizza took up nearly two thirds of a table for six. We were shoulder to shoulder. Thank goodness we all get along! This definitely isn't the place you bring your mother-in-law to.FoodI had the lasagna bolognese. There were so many layers to it, but it was mainly comprised of pasta. I felt like I was being ripped off with little to no meat or cheese. What was there had no flavor. It was all red sauce that I could probably find at HEB, but not Emeril's because there wasn't any ""BAM"" to it. I felt like I could have gone anywhere to get this dish. This dish would only be passable in a retirement home. My girlfriend had the insalata sicilians con tonno which I can only believe translates to ""canned tuna on a salad"" because that's exactly what she got. We expected a bit more since they had a seared tuna dish on the menu and the description made it sound great. When I saw her salad, I couldn't help but feel sad for her. It just looked like cat food spread across some greens. I couldn't even bring myself to try it. With the two disappointing dishes in front of us, I was offered some pizza from our friends. I couldn't. It looked like it was okay but probably not worth the $30 they charge for it. It had peppers and cubed sausage. That's about all I can remember. LiesWe were told ""good choice"" or ""that's excellent"" after each of us placed our orders. This must be some sort of lie that they keep saying in hopes that it becomes true. There's nothing redeeming about Numero28. There are too many detractors to make it worth going to. I tried and tried and tried to find something worth 2 or 3 stars, but I couldn't. I don't wish to recall my visit here any more. Thankfully everything was perfectly forgettable.",1.0 star rating

"We were walking around Austin and decided on Italian. Walked around and saw this restaurant. Loved it! We had the gin fizz and basil martini which was recommended. Started with beef carpaccio and some fried squid, followed by Eggplant parmigiana and lasagna bolognese and a nice chianti. Everything was delicious! Loved this place! Staff was friendly and service was fast.",5.0 star rating
"Whether it's a slice, a coffee, a pastry, a glass of wine or just a welcoming, authentic atmosphere, Bernardo and the crew at Numero 28 on 2nd St. is off the charts. I stop in every chance I get and I wish it was more often.",5.0 star rating
"Two words: food heaven. Quite possibly the best Italian food I've ever tried. I was planning on waiting for my birthday to come here. Well, I didn't wait. And boy am I glad I didn't!The bartender (and my former coworker) Marco waited on me and treated me like a queen. I started with a glass of my favorite wine, Pinot Grigio, and the best Caesar salad I have ever tasted, hands down. I was also treated to a delightful appetizer called Caponata con crostini, a Sicilian take on bruschetta that even this picky eater couldn't resist. The main course: Lasagna Bolognese. Mamma mia! If you try nothing else on the menu, you MUST try this. This dish alone is worth awarding Numero 28 the award for best Italian food in Austin. I normally plow through my meals, but this one I wanted to last forever, savoring every bite. Finally, the dessert. A small but flavorful cannoli, and the Semifreddo al Cioccolato (Semi-frozen Chocolate), an ice cream dessert that can perhaps be best described in English as Almond Mousse Delight. Trust me: you won't find this fabulous dessert at Olive Garden! To Marco and the rest of the staff: I salute you! Molto buono!",5.0 star rating

"Had lunch here yesterday, we are so glad we took a chance and walked by it.  Their second day open for lunch, so we scored!!The interior has a traditional osteria feel to it.  It is comfortable and super friendly.  Bernardo and Marco both make this place feel like the quintessential neighborhood joint.  They are personable, attentive and passionate people, this shines through all of their food, service and wine.No jokes, they have Prosecco on tap..  Anyone who knows my group knows that we love our bubbles.  From speaking to Bernardo, I can't wait for them to be open and serving weekend brunch!!  Mimosas and Bellini's yes please, hopefully sometime early next year.  They have 6-8 red and white wines on tap, I have come to understand that the wines they pick for draft tend to have less sulfides than bottled wines.  We had the prosecco, the pinot grigio and malbec..  For the price points all were great.Now to the food, you have got to try the Vegetarian Arancini, yes there is a meat one too, but the veg one I can vouch for..  It is awesome.  Crisp exterior, with an interior that is molten hot filled with yummy melted stringy cheese, spinach, squash, aubergine and encased with saffron risotto.  Just writing that has me wondering if I want to take a ride to 2nd St..  Salads are fresh and crisp.  Unfortunately the pizza oven is still out of commission due to red tape..  When that oven is burning, I can only expect some delicious pizza will be served up.  We had the baked Ziti Norma as our main course and it was perfect comfort food for a grey day.If you live in that neighborhood, I'm jealous of you..  When you are DT definitely recommend you stop in..  Even if not for a meal, they are now serving Gelato, have great espresso or just a glass of Vino accompanied by friendly chatter from Bernardo and Marco.",4.0 star rating
"So there are some really great Italian restaurants in town.  Vespaio, Aroma, Juliet to name a few.  But if you want REAL Mama made Italian you gotta come here.  Polpetta meatballs are great!   Pizza  is not Neapolitan (Aroma)  it the pizza is spectacular.  Service is great too!!!!",4.0 star rating
"I am in Rome! Mmmmm if you like AUTHENTIC Italian pizza this is the place to find it. I went to Italy a couple years ago and had amazing pizza. It is not at all like American pizza. This was hand tossed with the perfect crust, fresh basil, fresh cheeses, and perfectly smoked or cured meats. It has a drizzle of olive oil on top. For the other reviewer who said ""grease"" no my dear, that's olive oil. It literally made me close my eyes and feel like I was in Italy again. But if you are a fan of papa's pizza or any other generic American pizza, it may not be for you. I was in heaven. The owners were attentive and kind and so gracious. Best dining experience in Austin. The cannoli was perfectly light and crisp and melted in my mouth. I ate here the very next day so I could taste again. Amazingly brilliant food!! The pasta and the cured meat appetizer was phenomenal too!!",5.0 star rating
"Delicious Cicily-style pizza! We sat on the patio and it was such a great vibe. Tables are close together so be prepared to have dinner with randoms!

"It wasn't as awesome as I was expecting.Love the effort with the decor - its a nice showpiece of a place.We were a little stumped because we had a reservation for 5:45 on a Thursday (nothing between 6 & 7 was available online) but when we arrived, less than 10% of the tables were occupied and we were asked to wait ""just a couple minutes"" while they prepared our table.  Preparing our table appeared to consist of walking across the restaurant and conversing with a few other employees, one at a time.  That took at least 5 minutes, maybe 10 which annoyed me.  I speculated that it was perhaps a negotiation to determine which server would get the table.We were there for about 1.5 hours but it never seemed than more than 25% of the tables were occupied at any given time - which annoyed me again due to the fact that I would have preferred a little later.The waitstaff was dressed tidily and the service was right sized in terms of the number of touches.  For some reason that I can't explain - I felt like overall they were a little too snooty.Food was good, dessert was great.  Worth going once to experience but it isn't going on my favorites list.",3.0 star rating
"We planned a little get together to celebrate the startling fact that I've managed another 365 day rotation around the sun and it truly was a pretty fab experience. The complimentary valet is appreciated and the decor inside is a stunner. I've been here so long that South Lamar and Congress were seedy, sketchy parts of town when I was going to St. Ed's and I still find myself startled by the transformation of the area over the past two decades. What they've done to this space is glorious to say the least. It reminds me of my new favorite place in Denver, Avelina, in that it has a swanky, 1920s prohibition era vibe with a modern twist. Great textures and lighting and spacious seating even in the banquette table areas. The outside area and arched gallerie area that houses the study and tavern behind it do not remind one that they are deep in the heart of Texas. The oak bar they dismantled and drove down from New York is worth a visit just for itself.Our server was engaging, relaxed and my single friends got a little giddy whenever he approached the table-so fair to say that despite my hubby being there, we took great appreciation of his aesthetics! Drinks were very well crafted- we had the a who tequila drink with a touch of cacao. One friend didn't like it, so she switched to wine and I drank hers as well.We ordered the tuna tartare and crab and cornbread apps which were both really good. For dinner we ordered the braised short ribs. I know short ribs have been the darling for the past few years of most upscale places, but these were incredibly tender and savory due to an overnight sous bed bath and then a short braise the day of service. I only wish it had more sauce. It tasted delish the next say with a poached egg and leftover broccolini alongside the cauliflower and Brussles dish for brekkie.My friend had the tuna with kale salad and said it was perfectly seared and seasoned.The reason we took one star off was for the chicken dish. My poor hubby has a very limited menu due to health reasons, so he basically can just eat chicken and carbs. He ordered the chicken dish and while we were expecting a braised cow au vin dish, he was served a half chicken with salty, charred skin, no vin jus and the meat was very bland and under seasoned. I suggest they brine the chook to make it juicier and more flavorful and add more jus. The shells and cheese were also a little of a let down as the orecchiette were VERY al dente and chewy and the cheese sauce was just a little too powerful. Sadly hubby left hungry and disappointed, but the rest of the dinner and the lovely gold flecked desert were executed really well, so we will definitely be returning ad. Look forward to the roof top deck that is slated to open during the scorching summer months. Hopefully it will remain open in ""winter"" next season when it's the only bearable time to enjoy rooftop decks in the brutal, unforgiving Texas heat.",4.0 star rating

Last night I grabbed dinner with my friend Sandra. I just moved to Austin from Dallas. Parking was easy. Walked into such a beautiful ambiance I was pretty impressed because everything in Austin seems to be a little too hipster for me but not this place. This is the golden goose egg. Drinks were AMAZING. Our bartender Nicole gave us such wonderful service so we decided to ditch our table and eat up at the bar. This sounds weird to say but their salad dressing is amazing with little chopped upApples. The food was so great we decided to order about 4 more items and shared them. We caved and ordered dessert when we saw the menu. Nicole  recommended a banana pudding dessert and not only was it beautiful but it was melted in my mouth. I think I officially have a favorite restaurant in ATX. Thanks for the wonderful experience. I plan on going back very soon.,5.0 star rating
"A lot of pros and cons to this place.Actually.... a lot of pros and just a really bad experience overall. We went here last night for a birthday dinner for a couple of our friends. I was excited because I'd been once before in the bar area for flat bread and drinks.I appreciate the complimentary valet, for starters.The place is BEAUTIFUL! I love what they did with the decor. It's .... kind of Gatsby-ish I guess is how I would describe it? But they have a good size dining room, then a gorgeous atrium dining room for large parties (where our party of 14 sat), and finally across the way a big bar/lounge area, which you walk through the kitchen to get to (kind of cool, actually).So we sit down and waited. And waited. And waited.Now, in their defense, one of the birthday boys hadn't arrived yet. But we still wanted to order some apps and drinks.So finally, we had to grab the guy and ask for drinks. And apps. So he tells us about two app specials - the Eberly Cannonball (see pictures), a one lb meatball of dry rubbed, ground beef tenderloin with spices, sitting in a tomato fennel sauce (UH. MAZ. ING.) and calamari. I love calamari. So we ordered two of each for the table.And then 20 minutes later the waiter tells me they just sold the last calamari. Bummer, but okay. So the waiter says we can order apps from the bar menu, I say no thank you. He keeps trying to upsell us apps and starters the entire time. Even after the cannonballs (eventually) arrive.Anyhow, we order. I went with the venison and quail, with a side of their potatoes. We all shared, so I got to try a little of everything. Oysters, Chicken, Short Rib .....Everything was DELICIOUS.And for how long we waited for everything to come out, it better be.But I honestly thing what impressed me most was the mac and cheese. So then we ask for the check.I AM NOT EXAGGERATING WHEN I SAY IT TOOK THEM OVER AN HOUR TO GET THE CHECKS TO EVERYONE.Seriously. They kept getting the checks wrong, and finally had everyone just write down what they ordered on the back of receipts. AND THEN THEY STILL GOT IT WRONG.The manger (eventually) came out to apologize and told us we'd get 25% off our tabs. At this point, we all just wanted to leave. Another half hour goes by, and that goes up to ""25-50 depending on what we ordered"".Valet comes and gives us all our keys because they're leaving. It was that late.We didn't get to leave til after 12:15. Absurd. We got there at 8:30. C'mon now, how can you not know how to split a check? What kind of place makes you wait for everything, with no communication?So moral of the story - budget time accordingly at this place, because they do not have their shit together. I give three stars because the food and the ambiance of the place were worthy of 5 stars (although the portions were kind of small), but the service really got under my skin.It was extremely frustrating and I don't believe any of our group will ever be back, which is a bummer because the food was great.",3.0 star rating

"Not to much to say here besides the facts.Great ideas and setting for the finer dining community in Austin.  The food was magnificent.  The service on the other hand,  this is where I am at a lost for words.  Immature and childish.  Its like a bunch of teenage girls trying to be cool.  Its kind of offsetting to pay for a high dollar meal to be met with your high school drama kitchen.  Hire a staff that doesn't believe going out at night and getting wasted to return to work to just make a pay check is what is now Hip and Cool.  I want the owners to understand that they are loosing business because of their hiring techniques.  Get a chef who loves their jobs and want to see smiles on their patrons faces.  Not your Gabby who's trying to win the popularity contest.  Either way, give them a lesson on how being kind to each other is a better look than looking better in eyes.",2.0 star rating
"My boyfriend & I went to Eberly the other night to celebrate our anniversary. We booked through open table and added a note in the reservation that it was our anniversary. Much to our surprise, they greeted us with complimentary champagne for the special occasion! That was such a great way to start the night! The service was fantastic, and the space / decor was absolutely breathtaking.The food was very good. The complimentary bread and butter were to die for. And we also opted for the Burrata as an appetizer, which I highly recommend. For dinner, I had the Halibut. Not the best meal I've ever had, but it had a great flavor. I will probably try something else next time we go. My boyfriend had the steak. His steak was very undercooked when it was brought out, but they gladly took it back to cook more thoroughly when we asked. They took off 10% from our total bill for the ""inconvenience"" - we were shocked! Definitely check out Eberly next time you're in the area, it's a great spot!",5.0 star rating

"Convenient complimentary valet parking. A lot of work did go into the interior design. It's pretty and interesting but really a step shy of wow. It's loud. You can have a conversation, but only with someone right next to you. Service is polite but confused. Courses come out helter skelter, there may be a long break before the next plate, or the plates may pile up all at the same time. Once a plate is empty, it's likely to remain sitting on the table for a long time. Arranging everything on a two-top can be a challenge. Our menus even were never removed for the length of the meal. Raw oysters clearly shucked well ahead of time. I'm guessing maybe a few hours, as they weren't bad, they were just not entirely fresh and were a bit dried out. Crab and cornbread is as good as others say. Didn't care much for the Eberly salad; a bit hard to eat and not as much flavor as the description would indicate. Daily specials add a lot to the menu. Path from front to bathrooms is a bit confusing. Walk through the plating/serving area among all the waitstaff, or try to navigate around the tables and people in the main room. Once there, the co-ed bathroom is nicely designed, but really not a good idea. I think they're getting a lot of press because of the attractive space and interesting decor. Service and food are struggling a bit to keep up. We'll be back, it's a convenient and interesting restaurant. But I'm waiting to be a bit more wowed before hiking them to 4 stars.",3.0 star rating

"This is my go to swanky restaurant from special occasions to nice happy hour cocktails. My absolutely must have drinks are Anytime Tea, Sweet Heat, and Nutty Brown. In that order. The Crab and Cornbread is a savory and filling appetizer. That's my favorite appetizer at the restaurant. It's good for one person unless you have several appetizers to share. The charcuterie board and crudités are also excellent appetizers. The 20 oz smoked tenderloin, $85 Chateaubriand is a must try entree--very tender, thick, and juicy. Medium rare is the way to go. Note that it's a large portion shareable between two people. The butternut squash with sunflower seeds that it comes with is a perfect pairing with the meat. My personal sinful side dishes are the fries and the Shells and Cheese with gruyere (basically a Mac and cheese). You can't go wrong with dining here if you are into good food, good service, and paying for the breathtakingly elegant ambiance. Valet is mandatory and complementary. Don't forget to bring cash to tip them!",5.0 star rating

We could not converse so we yelled.Loved everything I tasted, ate, stole off someone's plate.The wine, cocktail and beer list is thoughtful and includes all you need. Loved the Patagonia Malbec.Fav food items: *A brussels sprouts and cauliflower dish with smoked chilis, anchovy, garlic, EVOO, butternut squash and balsamic vinegar.*The unique and tasty Angelina salad with arugula, basil, cilantro, spiced pecans, vegetables and a layer of pimento cheese on the bottom. *A delicious venison and quail dish with bacon, huckleberry preserve and pickled cabbage.*An earthy Gratin of potato and cheese with a crisp and chewy bottom layer.",4.0 star rating

"I was underwhelmed with my experience at Eberly. It was very overpriced. My date and I shared a $45 dollar steak, dessert, and 2 drinks, as we had appetizers earlier ($111 dollars total without tip!!). The steak was undercooked and tough, so rubbery that I could barely even cut the surface with the steak knife. For that price, I expect excellence. The drinks were really good, but also overpriced at $12; I have had better for less than $8. The dessert was excellent. The noise level was insane; my date had to scream so I could comprehend what he was saying. Overall, I would recommend Odd Duck over this place any day of the week! There, I will actually get excellent, perfectly-crafted tapas and drinks that will make me feel full. Don't waste your time and money here.",3.0 star rating
"After dining at Eberly last night, it is now at the top of my list for date night. Great architecture, friendly and efficient service, and perfect wine presentation by our server-- not to mention that the food was a 10! We started with the Eberly salad, then went on to the shells and cheese with the grouper special over risotto. Fish was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside- the risotto was mildly seasoned but paired with the reduction, it was the perfect amount of flavor. Would've loved to have tried a dessert, but $12 is a bit much after splurging for wine and dinner. The only other area of improvement would be to increase the space between 2-top tables-- a little too close for private conversations. Overall, a classy establishment with sure-to-please food items.",5.0 star rating
"The inside of this building like others have mentioned is beautiful. It looks like one of those old historical buildings that would fit in in Chicago or something. I can't say anything about the food or restaurant part of this establishment. I have only been to the bar for my cousin's birthday. We had some of their signature cocktails.The cocktails were pretty delicious. Prices were right around where you expect (~$12) but they tasted like quality. Between the 4 of us we had the ""Oaxacan on sunshine"" (tequila), the ""sgt. pepper"" (gin), the ""Honey Do"" (vodka), and the ""Raspberry Elyx"" (Absolut Elyx). My personal favorite was the Oaxacan on sunshine. You could smell that tequila from across the table.  So yeah it was strong but oh so smooth. If I wasn't driving I could have had several of those. I also want to mention their gender neutral bathroom. I really want to applaud the Eberly on this. Most places say a single room bathroom with one toilet is gender neutral, but this place does it right. The bathroom is one large room with like 8 stalls...(can't remember the number) with doors and sides that reach to the floor so there is no gap to peek through. It's meant for everyone. I walked in and had a little moment of panic as I saw a man walk out of one of the stalls. I'm glad that deer-in-a-headlights instinct took over before I bolted because immediately from another stall came a woman and it clicked! No distinction between men's and women's bathroom! Yeah it was a little weird at first, especially since the lighting in there was kind of dim, but made me feel really proud of this city. I plan on going back to Eberly to try the food it did smell pretty good!",4.0 star rating
"Umi Sushi Bar & Grill is another dissapointing reminder that you get what you pay for. That being said, they arent all that cheap either.The place is located in a strip mall facing I35, with a door that looks like it was purchased on an ebay auction and should have been used for a tropical fish store. The sushi-was modest quality at best although the portions are a decent size, the food lacks any originality. The eel avacodo roll has abolsutely no texture or flavor aside from ""warm"" and the rock-n-roll should be renamed ""rock-n-NO"". If it wasn't for drenching everything in spicy mayo I dont know if I would have even finished it. Speaking of tasty sauces....Eel sauce has always been a favorite of mine. At Umi though..eel sauce is about a single sugar grain and drop of water away from being true soy sauce and therefore giving you a salty finish with every bite.On to the good stuff.... Spicy Tuna! The rolls are nice and plump and the quality is pretty good. At $5 a pop i'd call it a pretty good bargain but it still doesnt counter the other shortfalls the place has.In summary I don't think this place is worth going to at all unless (A) you've never had really good sushi and have a completely blank canvas to start with, or (B) you really really want sushi and dont have enough gas to get anywhere better.",2.0 star rating
"Extremely disappointing. Haven't been back to Umi in years and now that I've revisited, I regret it. We stopped in midday during the week and were one of two couples in the entire restaurant. The entire sushi bar was hot (felt like they were trying to save electricity but not turning on the AC.) The entire restaurant had a hot, soggy smell. Sushi choices were bland and unimpressive.

"Umi is decent for an Austin sushi restaurant, but certainly nothing special.  If you're looking for an ""authentic"" Japanese sushi experience, this place is really not it.  Of course, most of the people coming here are probably not under that impression in the first place right?  The quality of their sushi is ok, but a little pricey for what you get.  Other items, like the tempura and chicken-katsu were fairly average.  Probably my biggest complaint about Umi is how dimly lit it is at all times of the day (even during lunch!).  What does that say about the restaurant if I can't even see what I'm eating?  On top of that, the moody neon lighting in the main dining area struck me as a bit more cheap karaoke bar in Seoul than serious sushi restaurant.  Overall, Umi is a bit too heavy on style and a bit too low substance for my tastes.",2.0 star rating
"I love their Sushi Happy Hour (Mon-Fri from 4 to 6 pm) and this has allowed me to explore all the items on their appetizer menu. I'm no expert on Japanese food but since I always go with a group of friends, the food and company have always made my visits wonderful.I've always had good service but that is probably because I make conversation with the wait staff when I'm waiting for my friends. So when you know you want a refill, it's easy to shout it over to the bar that you are ready for another.Weird location. Yes. Worth the visit. Most certainly.

"When I told Marla C. that I wanted sushi for lunch, she suggested we go to Umi. We'd been before but it had been ages, so we decided to venture down there today.First off, it smelled like a big fart when we walked in, but Marla C., always prepared, had matches with her so she lit one and things were better. It was really deserted, so there was no one to stare at us glaringly when she did that.The service was good (hey Maru, take notes), and the food was good as well. I agree with Marla that it was a little spendy ($11 for my shrimp tempura bento box, $1 more than most places). The miso soup was tasty, and I'm a fan of anyone who gives me tempura sweet potato and taro root so they scored points there too. All in all, I'd go back, as long as I had a pack of matches with me.",4.0 star rating
Went here for lunch on a whim and was very pleased with the lunch specials.

"Their happy hour is so cheap! Dollar misos, $3 appetizers, and mostly $3.50 for their basic rolls. I think Umi does contend with Kyoto, but some of their more special rolls are obviously more and not on the happy hour menu.

"My 1st review:Seeing as how I grew up in west TX, sushi was not something I was highly knowledgeable about. The closest I ever got to sea food was Long John Slivers and to this day I am terrified of that place and their deep fried belly aches they so proudly serve.I got into sushi a few years ago and can I say that I have been around the block when it comes to Austin sushi. Some say that Austin is a hard place to find decent sushi. I say they haven't been to Umi.I first went to Umi on a date about 2 yrs ago, and I continue to weasel my way into getting other dates to take me there so I can just get my fix. And my roomie and I try to hit it about 3 times a month.The food is wonderful! the fish is fresh, always tasty and they are never out of something. The rolls are terrific. they put a spin on typical rolls and then have some house specials that are amazing (try the Austin roll).The prices are reasonable and well worth the portion size. I have never seen bigger pieces of sushi or rolls at any place here in Austin. I know I can get full and not spend that much.They also play techno/dance music most of the time. Other than the food, this is the best part. I love the vibe and the sheer joy of eating sushi with pals and getting to listen to my fav house songs.The only reason I didn't give Umi 5 stars is the service. Every time I recommend Uni to someone I give them fair warning about the service. It's not the worst in town, but I'll tell you it's pretty bad. The food, prices and music outweigh it, so I will continue to be faithful to Umi and send others to experience the mecca of sushi.****UPDATE**** I am updating to 5 stars. One, because I still continue to go here and the owner is amazing. She knows her people and chats with each one like she is their best pal! Second, the service has come full circle. It no longer is bad, in fact-it's great. Great fix guys! Keep it up!",5.0 star rating
"I'm surprised to see everyone calling Umi expensive! I went there with a friend last Saturday night and the two of us only spent $35, combined, with tip. To me, that's not much to spend on dinner. Especially given the food we got for that price: two sets of 2pc sushi, four of the spicy shrimp handrolls and one of the 10pc rolls that's super long. We were both actually full, and my half of the bill came to $16. How long has it been since I spent $16 with tip on sushi for dinner and came out feeling full? A long time... never was a long time ago, right? Five bazillion stars for the nice waiters and mellow atmosphere - no scenster-istic wait times and noise. The quality of the fish was really good - definitely not a cheapo place. Better than Kyoto for sure. I do wish they had more rolls without egg in them, as I'm not the biggest fan of egg, but I was convinced to try one anyway and it was still good. Another firstSo, to sum up: Umi got me full for $16, was mellow on a Saturday night, and even got egg into me when I've never been able to eat it at any other sushi place. If you live south, this is a place to investigate. It's not worth a trip down south, but if you're already here it's a great option.",4.0 star rating
"I am a regular of this place and I have to say I haven't really had any bad experiences here.  We probably frequent this place close to once a week since it is right down the street from where we work and live.  By now, we are greeted by name by the manager lady as soon as she notices we are there.  It is a good feeling :)I love the lunch specials here.  I usually go with Lunch E because I really enjoy the two hand rolls that it comes with but I have tried all the others as well.  You really can't go wrong, and for $10-$12 for soup, salad, and sushi you get a pretty good deal.  Everything I have ever ordered here has been great.  Fish is always fresh and tasty and the service is always good.  The young waitress that works during the week is very friendly and attentive.  I used to be a huge fan of Silhouette downtown (I still am of course), but I hated spending 30 minutes looking for a place to park downtown.  This place is always a sure thing as far as finding a spot to park and not having to wait for a table.  They have a good happy hour m-f 4-6pm but that is always hard for me to make since I work until 6, but on Friday and Saturday nights they have a later happy hour from 9-close with good sushi and drink specials.  This isn't the absolute best sushi I have ever had (Musashino wins that but it is too expensive to frequent there) but for the price and specials this is our usual sushi pick.  I highly recommend this place for your casual sushi nights.",4.0 star rating
"I love Umi, by far the best sushi restaurant in Austin.  The prices are reasonable and the service is excellent.  The sushi chefs are friendly and are always willing to make you a ""special"" roll by asking what your favorite ingredients are, the price is about $14 for a special roll.  Be warned, there location is in a shopping strip where Fiesta and a mattress store are located.  It is not the location you would expect for the inside atmosphere and food quality but overall it is worth the drive down I-35!  They would outshine Kenichi if located in downtown Austin.",5.0 star rating

"I hate to write this review as I've been a faithful customer since 2006. I've always raved about this place to friends and experienced good customer service and food, however, this evening's visit was different. First off the food was not as good as usual, the crispy, spicy shrimp hand rolls (which had always been my favorite) were soggy and had too much schiracha sauce, I mentioned it to the waitress and she just kind of shrugged. Oh well, no big deal. My big disappointment was that I tried to order the vegetable tempura off the side item menu which was $4. The waitress asked me if I wanted the mixed tempura instead and not really knowing what she meant and figuring that it sounded good, I said sure. I looked at the menu as she went to enter it into the computer and realized that the mixed tempura that she had suggested came with shrimp and was $9. I'm not a shrimp fan and also didn't want to pay $9 for something I was ordering as a side. I went up to the waitress as she was entering it into the computer and told her I had misunderstood and to change the order to the vegetable tempura. She said ""oh, ok, let me run back to the kitchen to tell them""....I guess the order goes in that quick, even though she was entering it as I walked up. A few minutes later the manager (who I've always thought was a great woman because she is always there and seems to have a great work ethic) brings us the full plate of tempura with shrimp. I told her that I only had wanted the vegetable tempura and she kind of shrugs and just looks at us. My husband (who can't handle uncomfortable silence) said not to worry about it since all they would have done was to bring the plate back to the kitchen and take the shrimp off and bring it back out. I guess he didn't realize that we'd be charged for an incorrect order.  Usually when you are brought the wrong order, they either bring you the correct one or don't charge you for their mistake. Needless to say they charged us for the $9 plate of tempura and when I brought it up to the waitress who then went to the manager, we were basically told tough luck, you ate it.  So, on top of the food not being very good this evening, I was flabbergasted that a manager wouldn't give the customer the courtesy of not charging them for something that was brought to them erroneously. I have rented out their private room for birthday parties, gone to reverse happy hour at least twice a month, had date nights with my husband, raved about them to friends, taken pics of their usually awesome food and written reviews on Foodspotting and for that I get told ""well you ate it, you pay for it"". I myself have a business and would never treat my clients this way. Really really disappointing.  I will miss you Umi, you've lost a faithful customer over $5.",2.0 star rating
"Perception and opinion are interesting things, indeed.  The 0/1 Yelper, Adrian I., whose review is currently filtered, implies that I am a ""yelp [sic] ""professional"" blogger.""  And, without being too glib or literal, yes, I am a Yelper.  And as a Yelper, I am entitled to and, in fact, encouraged to provide my honest opinions about business which provides a service not only to Yelp users, but also to the businesses that I review, whether it be Trace or Taco Cabana or ""Michelin starred restaurants,"" which Adrian suspects I have ""never eaten in [sic]"".  The Food and Beverage Director at Trace felt that my opinions were valid and I can only assume that is why he invited Errol M. and me to dine at Trace for dinner this evening.  The head chef felt our opinions were valid and graciously came out to introduce himself and find how we were enjoying our meals.  And we honestly had to admit that the difference was like night and day.  He mentioned that they were having a tough time with the lunch menu, trying to feel out the neighborhood. As someone who works in the Second Street District, I gave him a quick rundown of what I thought about their nearby competition and listened intently (and excitedly) to the couple ideas he let us in on.  We were thanked repeatedly for giving Trace another shot because, as they mentioned, a lot of people write a bad review and never come back.  I remarked, ""or they never say anything and never come back"" to which the chef nodded his agreement.  'The customer that complains is the customer that is your friend' is something I learned studying business and marketing at college and also through my many years in the service and retail industry.  Tonight's experience at Trace is a perfect example of how Yelp should work: as a forum for Yelpers to give opinions, business to read those reviews and evaluate if those reviews have basis, and, if so, correct as needed.  I am truly grateful to Trace for their handling of the situation and treating us so well and will totally recommend them to friends and fellow Yelpers.  I look forward to dining there again for dinner and for lunch when the new lunch menu comes out.  Because in addition to being a Yelper, I'm also a customer, and at least the people who matter recognize that.",4.0 star rating

"The food is good! Shrimp and Grits = love!But the service is just so bad.I've been there for brunch twice in the last month and BOTH times my food was comp'd because the food never arrived. I had to ask 3x and it came after everyone else was completely done with their meals. There's a bunch of other little things - my husband ordering the burger with the fried egg and it came without the egg. When he asked 2x they still forgot to bring it. same thing with little stuff like Cholula - you can ask 3x and never get it.I don't think I'm that picky about service ;-( Not sure if the servers have too many tables or what's going on, but last week I had a smoothie and ended up asking for it in a to go cup since everyone else had eaten and was ready to go. When I went here at night, I had a better experience. The drinks are good and it was more fun people watching. The W is such a fun hotel and the brunch food IS good. I just wish they'd get the service together.",3.0 star rating
"A bit of a disappointment. My friend took me out for lunch at Trace to celebrate getting a new job with what she thought was the best burger in town. I was exited because she was paying and well, I love a good burger.Be prepared for atmosphere straight from LA. Grey velvet and giant patchwork mirrors dominate the space. I actually loved my seat as I had a long pillow to lounge against. Our waiter was fabulous. He recommended the jalapeno and cucumber lemonade that was quite delicious. Great cool cucumber flavor with a slightly spicy kick at the end. My friend ordered the soup of the day which was a cold carrot curry. I'm not the biggest fan of cold soups, but the flavor and texture was amazing.Then the burgers came out. We both had ordered them medium, which is pretty standard in my opinion. Instead we got more of a well done burger that was overly charred. The flavor had potential and I did enjoy the tomato relish on it, but it was a disappointment. The fries, on the other hand, were AMAZING! I really would like to know what they were fried in as I think that is a big part of their tastiness. I am very picky about french fries and feel most do not match the quality I am able to make. These are definitely the best french fries I have had in town.And here comes the best part about Trace: the service. Our waiter asked how our meal was and we both commented on the burgers being overcooked. After apologizing for the issue, he took our plates only to return with free dessert from the chef. He brought out the bread pudding and the drunken donuts. I'm a sucker for donuts and immediately loved this dish. The donuts are on the heavier side and dusted in sugar. Even though I want to, I still don't particularly like whipped cream with alcohol in it. Of the three sauces that come with the donuts the winner was the caramel sauce with bourbon. I couldn't get enough of it! The bread pudding was just ok. It's basically a giant cinnamon roll cooked in a dish barely larger than it is. It was hard for me to cut into it because of the size of the dish. It comes with a fudge sauce that was another of my favorites.The presentation of the food is terrific and there were definitely some great moments in the meal. The service was truly stellar and stood out from some of the similar establishments in town.",3.0 star rating

"First timer here - went for lunch and was under-whelmed.Pros: Beautiful and comfortable interior and was seated immediately during lunchCons: $14 for a ham sandwich with some pimento spread and pickles.  I expected for the price point for the sandwich to be elevated to finer cuisine than what it was. I could have easily made the same sandwich at home for half the price.  Also, my sandwich and fries were barely luke-warm.  My husband ordered the potato and cheese soup which he described as ""just ok""",3.0 star rating
"Trace has an impressive outdoor area along with a very trendy indoor scene.  The location is a perfect spot for drinks, appetizers, or dinner prior to a concert at the ACL Moody Theater.  The food is excellent and they can prepare many of their dishes Gluten Free although they don't have a dedicated Gluten Free Menu.   The salads, scallops, and steaks are a good choice, especially eating Gluten Free.  They have an lengthy drink menu and happy hour.  Their meals are a bit pricey so don't go to Trace if you are expecting to get a bargain. I recommend grabbing a spot just inside the restaurant next to the windows that are open when the weather is nice.",4.0 star rating
I absolutely love Trace. The outdoor environment is perfect for me.  I just moved from LA about a year ago and the outdoor W environment reminds me a lot of LA and makes me feel at home. The staff is friendly and attentive as well as knowledgeable. They change their menu frequently and everything on the menu is farm fresh.

"Sitting outside after a long day at the SXSW conference enjoying some drinks and great food. The service was great, attentive and able to deal with our twelve person group that was a bit high maintenance.  We started out with the combo appetizer plates that had cheese, olives, some picked vegetables and a few other things that I can't remember.  It was good, but not great, some of the items seemed very bar snack not nice restaurant dish worthy.    I had the snapper, and we pretty much had every dish at the table, everyone seemed very happy with the food.  Another martini.   We ended with chocolate martinis and every dessert on the menu.  The donuts were scrumptious, we had to get another order.   All in all it was a great dinner, fun, good food, great weather.  If I'm back in Austin for work, definitely heading back.",4.0 star rating
"The best meal i have had downtown. Starter: We had a jalapeño sausage.. that i can't seem to find on their online menu. It was fantastic. The sausage had a wonderful rich almost creamy texture. The fresh jalapeños had a nice kick. It was served with a peach ""ketchup"" that was sweet and tangy. A really nice starter. Truffled Mac and Cheese: Large shell pasta in a rich creamy cheese sauce. A very rich side but so good. Black Angus Cowboy Ribeye: 32 ounces of perfection. Best steak i've ever had downtown. Our waiter recommended we share the steak since its so big and to order a side. Really nice of him but next time i'm ordering the whole damn steak to myself. It came with a steak sauce that my husband said was ""insulting to the steak"". It didnt taste bad but you do not need anything with this steak. It is perfect. Drunken Doughnuts: I WILL ALWAYS ORDER THIS. ALWAYS! Fresh hot  melt in your mouth oversized sugared donut holes with vodka whipped cream, tequila chile fudge sauce and bourbon dulce de leche. The tequila chile fudge sauce has a strong initial bittery taste but it develops into a rich dark mellow flavor as you eat it. I personally liked it with both the vodka whipped cream and the fudge sauce. The dulce leche was good as well. Service: Impeccable. Atmosphere: Gorgeous. Tip: I'd avoid Friday and Saturday nights. The W's bar is filled with Ed Hardy/Miami style  douchebags and awful loud stripper looking women. I witnessed the most awful people i've ever seen in Austin. I really hope they are out of towners and not Austinites.",5.0 star rating
"I've been here several times for cocktails, but it wasn't until SXSW this year that I actually had a full sit down meal at Trace. Let's start with the obvious, it's drop dead gorgeous in here. And on a warm night the entire wall of windows opens up to the patio. Just beautiful.We started off with a country pork pate, served with dijon mustard and pickled cauliflower. It was fantastic! The menu has several charcuterie items to choose from, so I would like to go back and try some more.For my main course, I had the salmon served on top of kale with pork belly and apples. It was sooooo filling. It was delicious, but I had no room left for dessert. It can get pricy fast, so this will just be a special occasion place for me. However, I will be back for drinks and more charcuterie samplings!",4.0 star rating

"Went here for brunch with 7 other girls for a bachelorette party on Saturday. Amazing experience all-around!The staff was incredibly attentive, the food came out absurdly fast and was DELICIOUS, and the ambiance was wonderful. DJ I Wanna Be Her spins on Saturdays and created a fun party-vibe brunch.Our main server was Prometheus (I believe that was his name, I unfortunately did not save the receipt) - he was phenomenal.All 8 of us ordered a coffee and a mimosa or bloody mary each. The bride-to-be received an extra mimosa on the house that was made with a nicer champagne. Two orders of their Nutella Banana Bread mysteriously showed up on our table (another gift on the house). If you are considering this dessert, I highly recommend you just order it, it was incredible. We ordered 5 brunch entrees between the 8 of us. When we got the final check, we were stunned to see that ALL of the beverages (coffees, mimosas, bloody marys) AND the two nutella bread desserts were comped. The only items on our bill were the 5 entrees. That is a SIGNIFICANT amount that was comped and we were all thrilled.Apart from the great service and ambiance, we were all pleasantly surprised by the fact that the food was so good. We honestly mostly went for the drinks and the atmosphere without high expectations for the food. I ordered the Trace Market Migas and HIGHLY recommend that dish. Not really sure what the difference is between this dish and Chilaquiles (I think they are essentially the same), but it was the best chilaquile-type dish I've ever had.So at the end of this massivew review - GO HERE. You will not be disappointed.",5.0 star rating

"I've been to Trace twice in the last week, and had two very different experiences. I had a very nice lunch with my husband on the terrace on a beautiful fall afternoon. I loved the space, the ambiance both outside and the interior, and the service was spot on.  I had the vichyssoise and watercress salad, and loved both. My husband had the beef cheek sandwich and he liked it as well. I would give that experience at least four stars, however, I invited my friends to a Friday night dinner, which changed my mind. There were ten of us, and we arrived at 7:00 and were seated quickly. Our food arrived two hours later, at 9:00. Yes, it took two hours! I don't know what the issue was, but the waiter ( who was very sweet himself) said it was because we asked for separate checks. It shouldn't be that difficult to get separate checks. We had to be somewhere else at 10:00, so we had to eat very quickly, not to mention we were all starving by then. They didn't even bring the cheese plates we had ordered, which obviously doesn't require any cooking. One of us got his quail extremely undercooked, and had to send it back. They took that out of his bill, at least. And my friend who never got the drink he ordered, got it after we paid the bill, and were about to leave. And they had charged him for it! He literally had to gulp it down! I was also upset they charged for extra bread we wanted with our cheese plate. $6 for extra bread for $16 cheese plate. And we were also charged 20% gratuity for large party. I'm sorry I invited my friends here, and I will not be going back.",2.0 star rating

"Went here for a birthday dinner and while the food is amazing (seriously best Japanese cuisine I've had since moving to Texas) here are some tips/tricks to hopefully help make your dining experience perfect.The website for the restaurant states it prefers keeping tables open for walk-ins mostly but definitely consider making a reservation. Wait time to get seated was 1 hr 15 mins (got there around 7:30pm didn't leave till after 10pm). There is a patio seating area with servers that offer water, cocktails, appetizers and small 'bites' of neat refreshing combinations of what I can best describe as fruit ""salsas"" so it wasn't terrible...but if you have other plans following dinner you may as well look somewhere else.The restaurant is small and very lively which makes it difficult to hear party mates during a conversation. Didn't bother me much as I like that kind of atmosphere but something to consider depending on the occasion.Seating includes sushi bar, booths, half booth bench and chair table seating and plain table seating. If you're a short person, definitely try for a booth or bench/table combo because the regular 2 person tables and chairs are SUPER high. My feet were dangling the whole time. Granted I'm pretty short (5' 1"")...but as I'm sure most fellow humans of the pocket sized variety know it gets uncomfortable when you can't touch the ground after a while.Service is quick and the server was friendly and knowledgeable. Won't get too far into the menu as it's self explanatory on their website in how it's broken down. What I will say is all the food is appetizer size so don't expect to get large portions. There is a menu section with a 10 course tasting, 6 course tasting and vegetarian 6 course tasting option. We opted for the 6 course and it wasn't enough food to get full when sharing with someone else but it was AMAZING. I would recommend this option instead of the 10 course just based on price as it was significantly cheaper to do the 6 course and then just order something else off the menu before the dessert course. This was awesome because you get a good taste of the menu but can still try something else you didn't get in the tasting. If you're eating this on your own then it's quite a bit of food.All in all it was great, will definitely attempt to make it back sometime.",4.0 star rating

I imagine I felt like how Anthony Bourdain feels when he eats at El Bulli or some restaurant like that.The $$$$ is very intimidating, but if you go during the Sake social hour, it is much more approachable to the average diner like me. I would get the walu walu, machi cure, wagyu tartare, the avokatsu, and a dessert. However, you CANNOT leave without trying the foie gras nigiri, which was easily the best bite of the meal.

"This is the best meal I have had. Ever. Let me just begin by saying, yes, this is an expensive restaurant. You are probably going to pay a lot, but if you're coming here, you probably already know that. I spent around $110 for my meal including tip, but it was worth every penny. We came on a Friday night around 6, and had to wait for about an hour and a half. This didn't really bother me since it was a Friday night, and they had some outdoor seating where you could drinks and snacks served to you while you wait. We had some drinks, edamame, and broccoli tempura while we waited and they even brought us little free tasters to us as well!When we finally got seated, our server was quick to get to us and we got some things ordered right away. Every thing we ate, from the hot rock to the nigiri to the gorgeous dessert, was absolutely delicious. My favorite bite of the night was the scallop nigiri. SO buttery and melted right in my mouth. It also had a crunch element to it with the small piece of sea salt on top. What made my experience even more phenomenal was our server. She was attentive and knowledgeable, for example: we ordered the sea urchin nigiri first but she asked if it was okay for her to bring it out towards the end of our meal since it was a very rich piece.Overall, I would definitely come back to this place for all my celebrations, anniversaries, birthdays, etc. If you can afford to, definitely check this place out!",5.0 star rating
"Overall another fantastic experience during our week in Austin.  A local recommended Uchi to us and we were lucky to get a reservation at 5:15 on a Thursday, right around when the restaurant opened.  Good thing we called earlier in the week.Sometimes I feel silly writing reviews for lauded restaurants but I wanted to share some feedback for patrons as well as the establishment.    For patrons...1.  Go during happy hour.  They have fantastic specials including $3 beer & sake. 2.  Get the kinoko nabe.  Just do it and send me a thank you message later.  It's literally one of the best things I've ever eaten...true umami heaven.  If paella had a baby with a Japanese mushroom dish this would be it's beautiful baby.3.  When making a reservation, say something about the table location.  Even if they don't honor the request it's worth saying something.  We got stuck by the bathrooms in a high traffic area and it did impact he mood of our meal.  And with this I segue to our comment for the establishment...For Uchi...Please be considerate of your guests making reservations.  We sat at the table closest to the bathroom, at the end of the ""service circle"" (I think you know what I mean).  Because the dining room is tight, the staff has to make a circle around and were constantly bottle-necking at our table.  My husband is a big dude, over 6 feet tall and were were squeezed in a VERY small space...while 2 young girls sat at a booth big enough for 5 adults.This would have been a 5 star experience if it wasn't for our table.PS - The service was fantastic.  Mike was the best.  Give Mike a raise.",4.0 star rating
"We were very disappointed with Uchi. This was the one upscale dining place during our restaurant tour of Texas that I could convince my brother to spend on. For happy hour, the environment was very crowded and uncomfortably loud for a sit-down dining experience. The main dining room reverberated like a echo chamber. The most disappointing part of the meal was the food, however. The service was very slow and the meal timing was completely off. One of the dishes was good. But, the meal did not resemble the level of Japanese furious dedication to ingredients that I've been accustomed to having visited the top sushi restaurants of NY, California, and Japan. I wouldn't hold Uchi to these standards if they didn't charge NY-level prices and claim a James Beard Chef leads their team. The meal featured sushi rolls, a patently American invention for filling stomachs. This shows the chefs lack of dedication to quality ingredients in my opinion. The salmon sashimi with basil and tomato was an odd flavor choice, despite the salmon being of good quality. I was hoping Uchi would be a delightful Japanese refuge. Unfortunately it was loud, expensive, and lacked high-quality flavor combinations.",2.0 star rating
"I have to admit that we dropped in to Umi wanting a quick meal as we were on our way to a movie. What we found was really a pretty spectacular eatery that we will soon revisit. The wait staff was very friendly and worked with us to make sure we maximized our eating time. The complimentary mi-so soup was tasty and the salad that came with our entrees was plentiful. We ordered a seaweed salad as an appetizer and two of us were able to share sparingly. For our entrees, my friend had the shrimp tempura. It was by far the best we have ever tasted primarily because of the unique tempura batter. The tempura was light, non-greasy and along with the shrimp came a unique blend of tenpurad vegetable that were still crispy fresh. I had the black cod that was magnificent. Suffice it to say that several times I thought i was eating Chilean sea bass; that tender and succulent. For the price, this place is a must and I truly look forward to returning and doing the sushi and sashimi.",4.0 star rating
"I don't love Umi... and when it comes to sushi I have realized I must love the restaurant otherwise it is dead to me. The prices are a little high for lunch... yes, I am aware it is sushi but still. And the ladies at the hostess stand are always uptight, like it is such an inconvenience that we are a party of 9 in the middle of their dead lunch rush. And my biggest issue... the seaweed on the the sushi rolls is tough. I always feel like I'm choking on the seaweed. I will spare the details but it's just hard to swallow... literally and figuratively. On my last visit I tried a co-workers special roll with no seaweed and I must say it was very yummy and I will try it when I return... though I will only return when forced by the hand of my boss or friend.",3.0 star rating
"Maybe I'm feeling overly kind because Umi is only .5 miles from my house, but I like it!There's never a wait, as others have pointed out, but the 8-10 times I've been there, it's been 1/3 to 3/4 full. I'm not a super adventurous sushi eater, so that may be why I don't think it's expensive. The last time I went for dinner, two of us were full for a total of $40 including tip and that was with my one glass of wine.  I think the most I've ever spent was $45 when I was with a group that ordered the biggest sushi boat they have and several bottles of wine.  And their rolls have BIG pieces of fish in them, which makes me happy.  The decor is odd, but interesting in the same way that the techno music they're always playing is.",4.0 star rating

Ordered the escolar and it was very fishy. I explained that my intention was only to make the chef aware that it shouldn't be served to another guest and that I didn't need anything beyond that.I received a bunch of ridiculous excuses that didn't make sense without any apology or sign of remorse. I eat fresh escolar at other restaurants often and have not had a bad experience until now. Place has definitely gone downhill.,1.0 star rating
"My mom and I ended up trying this place out because the place we meant to go to was out of sushi rice due to a larger than expected lunch crowd.  Can't say I'm a huge fan of the decor, but the sushi was incredible and priced right!  Sushi was fresh and tasted great.  Plus, the rolls were really awesome.  You MUST get the longhorn roll.  Yummmmmm.  The waiter was really nice too.  I live in North Austin and this is located pretty South, so prob won't be heading back anytime soon, but I thought I would share so someone  else could enjoy.",4.0 star rating

"Umi is a relaxing sushi bar on Austin's south side just off the I-35 access road at Stassney.  The atmosphere, while a little odd, is nice enough to make you forget that you're in a strip mall facing the Interstate! The interior is roomy and comfortable, though they have a really nice, large bar for evening traffic. We joined another couple for lunch, and there were only half a dozen other diners there for a weekday lunch, with none at the bar. The portion sizes are quite generous, and the food tasted fresh. Our order included edamame ($3.50), beef teriyaki bento ($11.00), chicken teriyaki ($8.00), sake sashimi ($11.00), big easy ($8.50), a tiger eye ($9.00), and soft drinks all around ($2.50 each), for a total of just over $66.00 with tax. That's about $16+ per person, which is a little more than I like to spend for lunch, but it was delicious, and the service was very good and attentive.",3.0 star rating
"This was one of the best sushi places in Austin when we lived there (around 2003). It was the only one that we knew of in South Austin which saved us hours of frustration on the I35. The setting is modern and clean, although the slowly changing neon lights in the middle of the room are a bit disconcerting.I've eaten there over a dozen times and only once was the sushi a bit off. Most of the time it was good. I hear that it's now more expensive and less tasty, so hopefully someone who's been there recently will review it soon.",3.0 star rating
"I am confused with the ratings given to Umi. I would give their interior decor 3 stars but not the food.

Not coming back again.",1.0 star rating
"I have to say that I was impressed with my lunch at Umi today. After reading some of the reviews on here, I almost suggested to my co-worker that we go somewhere else, but we were both craving sushi.First impression walking in the door, really nice atmosphere. I almost forgot that we were in a strip mall facing I35. Plus, they have a really nice, large bar that I might need to go visit one day after work.The portion sizes are quite generous. I got the Lunch A, which is miso soup, salad, California Roll, Tuna Roll and Salmon Roll. All for $10! I really should have split the lunch special with my co-worker, because it was way more food than either of us could eat. With a soda, tax and tip, my share came out to $15, which is more than I would typically like to spend on lunch, but for the amount of food you get, it is worth it. I didn't think the miso soup or the salad was that great. I didn't care for the salad dressing, it had a weird hummus-like texture, but the sushi rolls were really good.",4.0 star rating

"Well, sonny, you're in luck. I ate there for lunch today and can address your concerns.  It is PRICEY!!!  We spent more than $80 for lunch for two (dinner will be a turkey sandwich and grapes at home tonight).  Not at all crowded and the traffic to get there from downtown for lunch was totally bearable.  Service was alright, but not commendable for much other than the accidental delivery of edamame to our table.  Nice to get it for free!The sushi was not so great, except for my new fave, the ""hot roll.""  That one is a new one on me -- apparently a deep-fried roll of crab and whatnot drizzled with a mayonnaise, chili and masago sauce.  Hot is for temperature and bite (though it's not really that hot spicy-wise).Otherwise, Umi is notable mostly for its accessibility.  You can get in with any size party at any time, apparently.",3.0 star rating

Oh and when you dine for happy hour, the pieces of fish are the same generous size you will find when paying full price!!!!!!  And the SERVICE is ALWAYS TOP NOTCH!!!

"Maybe if you're driving down I-35 and you simply do not have time to drive into town more than a quarter of a mile, Umi might be your thing.  Dinner for two consisting of a light selection of sushi pieces and rolls, a couple of miso soups and Sapporos = $75.  The intensity of the neon inside made me feel I might be at a dance club or a very sleek casino.  Sushi does not seem to taste as great, either, when a heavy purple glow is cast upon it.Take the extra time and venture into town for better sushi options.",2.0 star rating
"This place is horrible. Not only could Umi use some much much better interior designing, the food just doesn't seem fresh. Sometimes when I receive my appetizer it tastes as if it had just been microwaved. Some of the staff seemed very unprofessional... honestly it was like they were drugged up and weren't in their right minds. The manager who always wears a different colored button up sounds rude and impatient whenever I talk to him for some reason. I've given this place a couple second chances but that all ended after my last and worst experience there. I had been seated at a booth and as I took the napkin off the table to put on my lap a cockroach crawls across the table and under it. I seriously could not believe my eyes. I immediately left and I plan on never eating at Umi again. All in all,  I'm surprised it hasn't gone out of business, and I hope they've fixed their roach infestation.",1.0 star rating

"Reading all these wonderful reviews makes me think two things.One, this is an ""Emperor's Clothes"" situation and no one will write an honest review. Second, that we just came on a very, very off night and the food is normally wonderful.Our waitress was kinda rude and distant and seemed very judgmental when our friend said ""beer makes me happy"" (he was joking) when she placed his drink in front of him. She turned to him and said ""No, your CHILD makes you happy"" and turned briskly and walked away...we all started laughing like ""who is this lady??"" she glared at us the rest of the evening and set down our red plastic plates full of totally basic cafeteria food in front of us. This is not italian food. My pizza was thick with greasy cheese and was bland. The Caprese was meh, the Carpaccio was okay but no mustard, or capers or lemon even, it was just raw beef with arugula and some cheese.I just don't get it.Each couple paid $75.00 before tip.and yes, we did tip our judgy-wudgy waitress.

"As a (born in Italy) Italian-American  I have to say going to Italian Restaurants is not in general my favorite pastime. Too many times I have disappointed by the quality, so better stick to BBQ and Tex-Mex and cook Italian at home. I stand corrected now.Italian friends recommended this place and boy were they right. An experienced chef and skilled operator with a dedication to quality and service can turn things around, and Bernardo certainly did. I have been there already twice with my family and we were all left surprised delighted and -at times- jealous: where in the world they are able to score that incredible Sicilian olive oil? It puts to shame the swill that goes generally by that name.From the home made bread, the focaccia and pizzas to the excellent pastas and main course (the porchetta is to die for) you really can't go wrong. We ordered a bottle of wine once and it was very good, but I don't remember what it was so my bad. The second time was a lunch and we don't drink at lunch.Well, we generally don't drink at lunch but the new Mixing expert there treated us to one of his cocktails - quartiere Isola sorry don't remember the English name right now which was a first class cocktails, expertly designed prepared and splendidly served. My son also ordered a Mimosa which was excellent.I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant, which also offers pleasant and professional service. Enjoy the real thing, y'all. This is what Italian food is about.",5.0 star rating
"We were really disappointed especially after all these reviews....not sure this is even the same place. Maybe it's all about the pizza because it definitely wasn't due to the pasta dishes. The only slightly saving grace was the salad; the calamari was fine (avg for an Italian restaurant) and the pasta was sub-bar.  My husband ordered a lasagna and I ordered the pasta putanesca.  My husband  said it was like cafeteria lasagna and my pasta was squishy (not sure how else to describe it because it was definitely not al dente).  Our plan was to have a nice romantic dinner and catch a movie at the Violet Crown (babysitter taking care of our little one, etc) and this was a let-down.  My second choice was Peche (a ~ 7 min walk) - after dinner we decided to head out and walk to Peche.  Wow - night and day. There,  we enjoyed a phenomenal creme brulee and it was exponentially much more romantic.  Next date night - it will be Peche hands down.",2.0 star rating

"Stopped in for lunch one day and was lucky enough to get rockstar parking right in front.  The place is small but classy and boasts an impressive yet concise menu of Italian fare.  They have two different varieties of Prosecco on tap which is a winner in my book.  We tried the Numero 28 Pizza and the Arancina.  The pizza was tasty but personally didn't not enjoy the taste of Speck, I would definitely try a different pizza next time.  The Arancina was robust and delectable, would definitely recommend.  The staff were friendly and we were happily greeted by an Italian man who referred to me as ""Señora,"" which was strangely flattering.  I wouldn't say it's the best pizza in Austin but definitely worth a try and has some tasty items to come back for.",4.0 star rating
"Very friendly staff. Took our 3 kids (6,8&16) with us to dinner. No reservations and they got us right in. The only table they have available for 5 was in the very back. Looks like it could seat 8. Its a small place, so calling ahead would be a good idea. The pizza is traditional Italian thin crust. The 29"" is made in an oval shape. So we were able to make it three (3) pizzas in one. Just had 1/3 a different type. This worked well for the kids. They offer a good wine list. Well, they have an Amarone. Which in my book is the best Italian red wine ever made. So they got an extra star for that. Mainly baked pasta dishes. No spaghetti or ravioli. The food was very fast in delivery. It tasted great, good flavor and firm but soft penne noodles. But to my mind the place has a very limited menu.   So check it out, but review the menu. It is not very broad.",4.0 star rating
"Seriously, what a magical night.The other day, my boyfriend informed me that two other couples wanted to join us for dinner and that I got to pick the place. I never do! So exciting! Numero 28 had been at the top of my pizza-lust list for a while now, so I was extremely excited.I mean... really excited. We made reservations for 6 people at about 8 pm on a Friday night. Unsurprisingly, parking was atrocious and we paid $10 at a garage because we were downtown and I looked too pretty to walk too far. Although the servers seemed a bit frazzled when we checked in, I was extremely happy that they sat us with only 2 of the party present- a lot of places make you do that awkward stand to wait for the complete party... you're already holding our table, just let me sit!As we waited for our party to arrive, we ordered some wine. The great thing about Numero 28 is that they have draft wine. What is draft wine? I don't know, but the one we ordered was DELICIOUS. I loved the numerous size options and the fact that they really kept it flowing. That delicious wine that we ordered? It came in a carafe and I don't believe I refilled my own glass even once. The service was incredibly attentive and unbelievably timely.Still waiting... we ordered a pizza as an appetizer. I'm really not a fan of mushroom or truffle, however, I knew I was ordering a margarita pizza for dinner- why not let my boyfriend pick this one?...Let me repeat. I don't like mushroom/truffle. THIS PIZZA WAS DIVINE. One of the best I've had in Austin. I ate my share and had to stop myself. The crust was perfect. The cheese was perfect. My mouth was so unbelievably happy. If I love this pizza this much.... how much will I love a pizza with the toppings I favor?!At about this time everyone else arrived. They ordered wine and food and we waited and talked and had a good time. By the way, I ordered the seared Tuna as my entree. As much as I loved that mushroom pizza, I knew waiting until next time for that margarita would really make it a transcendental meal.The tuna was amazing. Sushi grade yellow fin, seared perfectly, with a beautiful and flavorful crust. The cook was the perfect shade of red you would expect from a fish centered restaurant, with so much flavor and texture. AMAZING TEXTURE. The bed of cous cous it was served on was so impressive; I had assumed, ""cous cous? pfft, I can do that just as well at home."" No, not so. At $18, I consider this dish a complete steal when compared to similar wonderful dishes at other establishments.The food was a 5. The drinks were a 5. But what really surprised me was the experience. The gentleman who helped us was so earnest. I assume he had some stake in the business- he was a passionate, fun Italian who had no problem correcting my boyfriend on his pronunciation of Prosciutto. Throughout the meal, he was a complete pleasure and well of knowledge.The room itself was so perfectly casual yet pleasant. As I've said, through the night, a drink was never left empty nor a need left unmet.I really had an exceptional time.I eagerly await returning to Numero 28. The overall experience and drinks they offer are so above par and I can tell you that I purposefully wrote this review before trying their margarita pizza because at that point... there may never be another pizza review worth writing.",5.0 star rating

He seated us in the bar , gave us complimentary proseco and caponata, the latter we ordered as an app after being seated shortly after. We also got the calamari, both apps were outstanding.Got one white and red wine, both were excellent for the price point. $16 for medium carafeThe main course while being good , we felt wasn't great, which when we mentioned about it to fore mentioned gentleman, gave us dessert on the house.

"An enjoyable 1st for me: first time walking around downtown at night, first time eating in a tiny Austin restaurant, first time at Numero 28.An out-of-town family member was in Austin for the weekend; we met at 1st and Congress and considered where to enjoy dinner.  One member of our party seemed to recall a co-worker enjoying a pizza place, ""off down this way.."", so we set out with the rest of the throng milling about downtown on a Saturday evening.  Four or five blocks later, we thought we'd struck out when I spotted some tiny, ""pizzeria"" letters peaking through the leaves across the street.Surprisingly enough, they seated us immediately and supplied water--much appreciated after walking through the dusky summer warmth of September.  None of us was incredibly hungry, so we ordered a single, 18"" Prosciutto pizza.  The tomato, mozzarella, arugula, Parma Pronciutto, and parmesan on a thin crust was quite tasty!  Service was attentive, and we enjoyed a nice supper.Please do not misinterpret my three-star rating.  What Numero 28 did, they did very well-- from what little I know of that restaurant style.  We simply do not frequent that type of establishment often, and I cannot see myself making a trek into the heart of downtown Austin (something I rarely do for any reason) for this food.  However, if this style of dining and this location is your world, go for it!",3.0 star rating

My only complaint would be that the pricing is a little high for the amount of food, but that's probably because I'm so used to ""American-sized"" portions and this is not an Americanized Italian restaurant. Next time I'm here I'll be looking to try the caprese salad, the lasagna, a cannoli, the gelato, and the wine on tap!This is a small chain that started in New York and has started to expand globally.

"WILL NEVER GO BACK TO TRACE AGAIN! The service was AWFUL!  And I'm not talking slow, forgot our order, or anything like that.  Up until the end of our meal everything was quite enjoyable, but immediately after I told the waiter that we had a Groupon everything went south fast.  I'm not sure if our waiter assumed we wouldn't tip due to the Groupon or he was just unprofessional but he treated us with complete disrespect and was without a doubt the rudest waiter I've ever had.  After insulting my friend and I and suggesting that we could not do ""simple math"" when the ticket was clearly not adding up, he actually said ""did you forget that you had two drinks?""  After these two incidents we asked for a manager and the bartender showed up at our table.  We asked if she was a manager and she said no.  We never did see a manager and left.Oh, p.s. the food was great... doesn't really matter at this point.",1.0 star rating

"Unfortunately, my experience was pretty abysmal! For a brand new swanky hotel, we were in shock that it was empty at 9pm on a Saturday night! There were 10 people in our group and the service should have been better. The waitress seemed overwhelmed and only came by to take our order. I remember asking another waiter to order a drink. We ordered the following:Antelope tar tar was delightful!Charcuterie Board- Cheeses, Olives, & Country Pate were pretty standard.Deviled eggs were dire. The only good thing was the texture. An enhancement would be if it was topped truffle oil rather than white truffles.Strip steak was average & charred. Good quality ingredients but not prepared properly 100 %Sea Bass was their special and it was enjoyable but what they stuffed it with was pointless.Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Chop was juicy but flavorless.The ambiance of Trace is similar to all W hotels- dark, sleek, and trendy with loud pulsing ambient music playing. After spending the day exploring, Trace doesn't really fit into the Austin scene of laid back, artsy, and non pretentious.  Overall, 2 stars for the food and an extra star for the ambiance. Inside the hotel, there are also 4 different themed bars next to the restaurant. I suggest skipping the food and checking out the 4 djs playing different music in each room!",3.0 star rating

"I attempted to settle this matter privately by emailing the management staff at Trace, they have refused to answer my e mail or address our experience... therefore... Let me first say, this is the first time I have ever complained about service at any establishment. This is uncomfortable for me but I believe it is important. I am a native Austinite, I am in the service industry. I have owned my own business as a hairstylist for 10 years. My husband is the AGM for the Italian restaurant (Osteria Pronto) at the JW Marriott opening in a few weeks. Truly, we know and respect the industry.I sat down with another couple at the bar at Trace on Tuesday (1/27) at 5:45pm just before going to Kevin Hart. The bar was steady but certainly not overwhelmed. Our bartender was tall and slender, wide rimmed glasses, maybe late 30's. It took much too long to get his attention or order drinks, and our bartender seemed inconvienced by us being there, and certainly by us wanting to order drinks and food. My husband was walking over from the JW Marriott to meet us, I ordered him an ""old fashioned"". I was abruptly told that because my husband wasnt there I couldnt order for him. Again, we are industry, I understand the rules and if someone not being present means you cannot order a drink, I understand that. However, I was spoken to harshly, he was condescending and incredibly rude. I smiled and said, I would just have my drink and wait on my husband. I have honestly never been spoken to in such a way. We are polite people, happy to play by the rules and tip a base of 20%. This was uncalled for.We recieved our drinks and dinner, and after a while wanted to order another round. We waited at least 10 minutes without seeing a bartender at all... we asked the bar backs if they could help, as polite as they were, they werent interested in finding our bartender. Once he returned we said we would like another round, he pulled out his cell phone asked us to wait a minute, replied to a text and then took our order. Once the check arrived we looked it over and saw that one of my husbands drinks was a HH price, one was not. Also, both of my Titos and soda were full price.  We politely brought this to his attention, he snatched the bill from my husbands hand and insisted that the Titos were not on the HH menu. Of course they are on HH. He fixed our bill and never once acknowledged his wrong, apologized for his incredibly poor attitude, or cracked a smile. We were insulted by what we experienced at Trace.Again, we live here, we work here and we spend our money here. We are downtown all the time. We enjoy spending our time and money at fine establishments... which we believe the W to be. We were incredibly disappointed.I dont know if we will be back after this experience, but please prevent this from being another couples memory of the W Austin.",1.0 star rating
"The Perfect Place to Get Your Bravo Housewife On...This is the perfect place to go when you're not very hungry, but you want to get dressed up and sip on a drink with friends in a trendy, beautiful setting.

"I love dinner at Trace! You can't go wrong with the market plate - a little bit of everything - matched with the mac and cheese. In fact, that's the only thing I seem to be able to order, and it's always so good, I can't bring myself to ever change my mind. The cocktails are great too.",4.0 star rating
"Had a ridiculously amazing dinner at Trace the other night.  I have been in a handful of times prior for brunch, which I also recommend, but this was my first time eating off the dinner menu.  Started off with the charcuterie plate, which featured the country pate, pork loin, and lamb sweet bread terrine.  Each were delicious.  For my entree I had the pork chop, which was delicious and huge.  My date had the fried chicken, which was also tasty.  I also enjoyed the Fever Dream cocktail.  I would highly recommend having a meal at Trace.",5.0 star rating
"Drinks, appetizers and dessert were by far the best part of the meal for myself and 2 friends last night. I was slightly disappointed with the entree. I had the ravioli and it was lacking in flavor. My friend had the chicken thigh and sausage and she was less than impressed. Another friend had the salmon and was content with hers.Crab cake appetizer very good, but very small portion.  Hush puppies and dipping sauce good as well.  Mac-n-cheese so-so.Cilantro margarita very good (I requested it up instead of on the rocks).  The best part was the Drunken Doughnuts.  DELICIOUS!!",3.0 star rating
"Okay, so it didn't hurt that it wasn't busy and we literally had THREE full service attendees last night for our intimate dinner.  And it also didn't hurt that they were profusely appreciative of the Twitter chatter I generated with friends before I arrived last night about how excited I was to finally get to the W and Trace last night after hearing great things.  They truly get extra brownie points for going out of their way to notice my profile photos, recognize me when I walked in, and pass the word to my waitress to thank me.  Wow.The chef send out a tray of munchies while they were working on our order.  The little bowls of goodies, slices of gouda and grilled bread were nice.  The bread could have been a little more special had it been kept warm, as it is it was kind of just something to put my yummies on.  But I digress.  They've either changed the recipe or another reviewer and I have a difference of opinion about the deviled eggs.  These were ambrosia.  A hint of anchovy, maybe...some ground onion?  Not sure what it was but it was heavenly for such a humble munchy.Can you say H-E-A-V-E-N?  The bed of kale that my salmon was presented with was indescribably creamy.  I'm not sure I really want to know how much butter or what else was in it.  All I know is that I wanted to inhale it...yet I remained a lady.  The chunks of butternut squash, pear, and pork belly were the perfect accompaniment to the crispy, seared salmon.  On the pork belly, there was more fat than I like in my chunks so I trimmed them.  As flavor or presentation enhancements I'd like to see them use a better cut of pork belly, since it's kind of a fine art.  But this was minor.Okay, so the highlight of the dinner was a fabulous LARGE white bowl, perfect for two.  The dark chocolate pot-de-creme itself was miniscule and wasn't anything truly special but the presentation and accompaniments put it way over the top.  Caramel and bananas as a base, topped with a FRIED (yes, I said ""fried"" as in, chewy, wonderful outside) chocolate truffle, a side of Bailey's ice cream, and a SWATH of gorgeous, fluffy, perfectly prepared meringue attached to the wall of the bowl.  Like I said, niiiice.The atmosphere here which is uniquely intimate, the service impeccable (my requested glass of wine with dinner arrived to the minute as I requested) and the discounted valet for dinner guests combined to make this a truly memorable FIRST visit for me to Trace.Um, yeah...I'll be back!",4.0 star rating
"After a long absence, we returned to TRACE twice recently and were very impressed on both occasions with both food and service.  It becomes a pricey dinner after all is said and done, but worth it.Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin was as tender as it gets, and the crispy bacon on the exterior provided plenty of salted oomph without overpowering.  Accompanying cheddar grits were delicious.  Braised lamb shoulder with spiced peanut curry and couscous was very savory, not actually spicy, and an ample portion.  The Butcher burger was fine although it was the garlic fries that were truly great. Mixed feelings about the Watson's ketchup but appreciate that they are trying something different.  Bluebonnet garden salad was totally fresh and dressed perfectly -- light, as we requested.  We had it both visits.Service was 100% professional (although these were off-hours and they were not challenged by many patrons).  Handsome room and ambiance.",4.0 star rating
"My boyfriend and I came here last night and were pleasantly surprised to find out it was the last day of restaurant week! The ambiance and interior design was amazing and we got a great seat by the open patio doors. The service, as I've seen in many reviews, was meh. I'm not complaining, I've just had better. We both ordered the quail which was amazing, and I ordered the lamb shoulder which was AWESOME. My boyfriend got the redfish which was recommended by the server, but turned out to be kinda blah(lol @ my boyfriend for getting stuck with it). I would go back because it reminds me of my favorite contemporary restaurants in Chicago. Unfortunately the prices are also reminiscent of Chicago. Edit: $12 for a glass of MacMurray Pinot Noir is actually normal, my bad.",4.0 star rating
"ARW review...Went last night for restaurant week and enjoyed myself. too rich for my britches though. Now of course, I didn't have to start my night off with a  grapefruit cocktail that rang in at $13 (SO good), or split a bottle of wine with my two gals pals...The three course meal was $35 which allowed you to pick one app, an entrée, and a dessert. I started with mac and cheese which had seom crunchy topping and, my favorite, bacon. Win. I tasted a bit of the salad (bonus points for watermelon) and the pea cake (kinda boring). I got the pork with peaces entrée. It was good, but not spectacular,. Pork was a little oercooke/dry for my liking, and I actaully would have liked more peaches. There was a kind of nut paste underneath that was a good call, but then there was a seemingly random bit of pesto that I thought was odd. Not really necessary. The chicken dish looked great, tons fo food, and the bit I had was nice and moist. Plus, the two giant fries it came with were fun. We ordered the strawberry shortcake, cinnamon roll bread pudding, and salted caramel torte for dessert. Cinnamon bread pudding won first first - I typically don't like soggy bread - but this was just like slightly undercooked cinnamon roll drenched in icing (but not a super sweet fake icing). Good stuff. Shortcake was boring and salted caramel thingie was good, but not to my expectaion (I wanted gooey-er, saltier, more caramely).The service was excellent, in particular a random gentleman who stopped by just as we were contemplating the wine list. Very knowledgeable, and just charming as all hell.Might go back for a cocktail (hopefully there is a hppyhour?) on the patio to people watch.",4.0 star rating

"We ate breakfast here and felt that it was way overpriced for what we got. First of all, everything was under seasoned. I had the brisket hash and it was essentially mashed potatoes with some teeny tiny little slivers of brisket. It was supposed to have green chile in it, that was nowhere to be seen. My husband had the Austin breakfast with smoked bacon. We felt that we could have prepared a far better breakfast of bacon and eggs. The patio is nice and the service was fine, we would definitely not return due to the price and quality of the food.",2.0 star rating

My experience have been most positive with their waiters and bar-staff. Given the needs to impress, TRACE delivers.",5.0 star rating
"Brunch Review!An excellent brunch place for a sunny morning because half the seating is outdoors. They take reservations which is a big plus. They have a live band. The prices are reasonable for brunch at around $10-15 an entree.  The drinks are standard brunch fare and there's not a unique take on them. Overall, it's an upscale place that offers everything you're looking for in a brunch at a good price.",4.0 star rating
"Chicks & Sticks here's the lowdown - I was looking for an upscale restaurant to celebrate the beauski's birthday. Thanks to Yelp, I found Trace. The ambiance was exactly what I had in mind but the service?? I think we would have had a better time if we had NO waitstaff. We had two servers, Ben & Jordan. Jordan appeared to be our back server and was nothing but a joy. For the brief moment he waited on us, we chatted about Louisiana, Austin, and food. He was excellent. Ben on the other hand....uhm maybe service is not your strong suit? While we were not looking for special attention, SOME would have been appreciated. We ordered the hush puppies and mac & cheese to share, the beau had the steak, and I had the braised lamb. We ordered the infamous drunken donuts but enjoyed the hush puppies by far. After dinner, we mosied over to the lounge and enjoyed after hour cocktails and people watching. Overall the food was great and the short stroll to the lounge was a plus. The parking was a pain (we parked in the $5 lot across the street) but it wasn't a big determent. Would we try Trace again? Sure but with MUCH lower expectations.",3.0 star rating
"Good lord, someone please tell any Austin area real estate venture capitalists and restaurant groups that Austin is not, and is proud to not be, New York City! Trace at the W not only does not belong in Austin, the food is a pompous attempt at couture cuisine with about a 1 to 9 amount of food to price ratio and a similar taste to price ratio as well. I went to Trace one summer evening with a friend for drinks. Both of us hail from the metropolitan northeast and thought we'd have a 'classy night at the W' with a few drinks. When we arrived, we were greeted by the host staff, who asked us if we wanted to sit down. We were only there for drinks and post-work chatter, but we sat down on the patio outside. The W's ambiance is, unsurprisingly, crisp and sleek with mod art, décor and furnishings in every nook and cranny. The waitress came by to take our orders, after which she was awkwardly surprised that we were not interested in food as well. After asking three times if we wanted some food as well, we felt awkwardly compelled to order soup appetizers that were circa $12. Our soups arrived and, quite simply, were spiceless if not tasteless; I have been much more satisfied with the boxed soups found at the supermarket. We paid our $65 bill (two drinks and two soups) and crossed the street to dine on pizzas ten minutes later at Taverna. I've been back to Trace for a night out; ambiance is as you would expect, pretty pretentious, dark and loud with an overly expensive drink menu. Granted Austin is growing at an exponential rate, I hope that Trace is able to settle into Austin and pick up a bit of ATX flare and spice; if not, I don't know if it'll make it.",2.0 star rating
"Ok, my gut instinct would be to give them a 5, however a 5 would mean a few things: best overall food, best overall experience, best overall staff and if you want an honest review I would be lying that their food is the BEST in the world. There food is perfect in many ways but I would rather shoot people straight.Trace is the place I come to when I need to feel comfortable, the open doors and bright light make it the perfect place to relax and feel at ease. The restaurants seating arrangement is perfectly designed to make it a spaciously enjoyable place.Aside from the wonderful accommodations, the staff is amazing. I honestly can say they have chosen the best of the best in restaurant waiters. My personal favorite Javier is always checking in on me, always one step ahead of me when it comes to my needs. As I try not to play favorites, the other members of Trace staff are delightful and on time every step of the way.Now to the food, my personal recommendation right now is the dirty rice stuffed Quail, the chef literally never fails on this. It is ALWAYS consistent which is something I think you can appreciate from any restaurant and it is delicious. No bone found ever. For dessert I suggest the Drunken Donuts although all of their desserts are beyond amazing. I just happen to have a 4 year old who is a big fan of the donuts so what can you do.Overall, I will always come here, in fact I pretty much reside here due to my love for consistency and pleasant people. Trace is really doing something for the W and if all the W's around take note, they should be forming more and more places like Trace.Cheers!",4.0 star rating
"Delicious coffee shop shop with fun, unique drinks and a nice atmosphere to go with them. If you're coming here for a bite, I recommend the breakfast tacos.

"Based on my initial impression, I would call this more of a brunch/lunch spot rather than a coffee shop. HOWEVER, the iced turbo is pretty dang delicious.

"I found this place randomly while walking downtown with friends during SXSW. It was pretty chilly outside, so we decided to make a quick pit stop for some nice warm coffee.There was a long line inside, but there were two little windows outside convenient for placing to go orders. I ordered a plain latte and an Iced Turbo (I know I came in for warmth.. but the Iced Turbo was calling my name!). The Iced Turbo came out immediately, and I really enjoyed it! It was very sweet, which was perfect for my sweet tooth. It contained coffee, espresso, hazelnut, chocolate, and cream. The latte came out 10~ minutes later, and I enjoyed it also.For seating, there was a patio area in front with bar stool seating and table seating which were convenient while we waited for our drink orders to come out. It was definitely a good place to people watch and socialize.Overall, I really enjoyed the coffee and would definitely come back to try their food menu items next time!",4.0 star rating
"Ordered a hamburger but they gave us the poblano chicken burger instead. It was good, just not what we had ordered. We also ordered the turkey sandwich with sprouts, avocado and spicy mayo. It was very good but BEWARE that spicy mayo has a lot of kick to it! Would've gave them a 5 star review but they got the order wrong. Also, we were looking forward to the breakfast menu but got there at 1 instead of 12 so remember that breakfast ends at noon on weekends and 11am on weekdays. P.S. Parking around the area is horrible but if you're from or live in Austin, you probably already know that. If you're visiting, leave about 30 minutes in your schedule to find parking. We went on Sunday, which is free street parking, so it took us awhile. We ended up parking about 3 blocks away and just walked to Jo's.",4.0 star rating

"Quick summary: migas tacos = ****ing great, iced turbo = I want more now please, but serve breakfast on weekends later, you fools (at least during major event weekends)I came here when I was looking for a place to get some breakfast one morning during ACL weekend. So, there's a huge asterisk that comes with that. I was on the fence about going in because a line was already starting to form, but someone was eating a breakfast taco outside and I was inspired. I figured there was good reason this place seemed more popular than others.It took a while to order and get food, but I wasn't in a rush. I'm not blaming it on them, it's a busy weekend. It'd be like complaining about traffic at 5:30 in Washinhton, DC - expect delays. If I had gotten here at 10 instead of 11:15, it probably would've been quicker.I got two migas tacos and an iced turbo. Holy fucking shit. Delicious. Worth the wait. The tacos were spicy with eggs and cheese and potatoes and crunchy tortilla strips. Nom nom, motherfucker. The iced turbo... why isn't this recipe stolen and used everywhere? Or have I been blind to it till now? Like, I want to move to Austin just to get it at a semi-regular basis.I deducted a star because they stopped serving breakfast a few people behind me and I could tell people were disappointed. It's the ACL Music Festival. People are hungover, getting up late, and want your hangover friendly breakfast foodz. Give the people what they want! Huevo rancheros at 2pm! Breakfast taco with a side of loaded fries! There'll be no stopping Jo's if they didn't limit themselves. You're a fucking coffee shop. Breakfast all day, motherfuckers.I will definitely come back next time I'm in Austin.",4.0 star rating

For 13.00 can a brother get a sausage?We had to order bread and dessert just to get full.

"Came back a second time to trace and although it wasn't terrible, it wasn't as great as my first experience.  The fries are delicious. I reordered the pasta dish because I loved it so much the first time, but I was a tad disappointed.  The pasta was quite thick, not cooked enough (less than al dente as a reference point) and the meat was dry.  Even with these mishaps, it still tasted good, since the cream of the dish helps moisten everything up a bit, but it definitely wasn't great. My husband had a lamb dish on roasted vegetables.  I only tasted his acorn squash which was terrible.  It was the consistency of sawdust.  He also seemed to be missing some of the vegetables listed on the menu.  Based on the vegetables alone I probably would have sent that dish back had I been eating it.  I tried the carrot cake which was a bit too sweet for my likings.  I much preferred the chocolate dessert from my first go round at trace. It was a busier night and service was noticibly slower, but our server was friendly.  We were using a gift card to pay for dinner and I have to admit that if I had been paying out of pocket, I would have been a bit disappointed with the meal overall in comparison to the cost.",4.0 star rating

"I have this absolutely fabulous, smart, hip, hilarious and stylish client who was celebrating his 26th birthday, so I wanted to take him someplace trendy and delish for his birthday lunch. Having had several great experiences in the lounge, I thought Trace would be the perfect spot to treat my client for his special day. Sadly, I left rather flummoxed by the whole thing.Let's note the positives first- we were greeted by the always delightful and hospitable concierge, (NOTE: you DO pronounce the ""G"" in concierge- I don't know why Texans make it silent) who graciously escorted us to the restaurant where we were greeted by a friendly hostess and I was impressed with the overall decor. Very trendy and urban-I really thought we were off to a superb start!Sadly it took a turn for the worse after that. We ordered starters of polenta and chickpea ""Fries"", Beet Arancini and Deviled Eggs. A few moments after we placed our order the server returned to inform us they were out of the beet arancini. She made the arancini sound so fabulous!!! What a let down! I wondered how it is in 1/3 full spot run by a major hotel chain with tight quality controls that the kitchen had not informed her at the beginning of service that they were out of this appetizer?Once the other two starters arrived, we all tasted and shrugged-Meh. The ""Fries"" were thick, unseasoned planks of fried polenta served with a few wedges of lemon. These were SCREAMING for dipping sauces and at least a little parsley chiffonade. As for the deviled eggs- my mother's are much better and they could use a dash of curry.I had a chance to peruse the menu earlier that day and the short rib ""Bahn Mi"" looked appealing, so I was disappointed when we were informed that it was not available but would be substituted with a lovely Cuban Press sandwich with pork shoulder, ham and fresh Swiss on a French baguette. My co-worker ordered that, I ordered the Pakora sandwich with mixed spring veggies, cucumber raita, Tamarind sauce. My fabulous client ordered the Brisket Sandwich with ""Drunken"" cheddar. A few moments after we ordered the server returned to inform us they were out of the Cuban sandwich. How could that be?? The place was 1/3 full?? So my co-worker settled on a Croque Monsieur. My pakora was an over cooked, fried and greasy mess with little flavor, the croque monsieur was drowning in Mornay and the brisket sandwich looked very boring. The whole thing was very anti-climactic indeed and I was embarrassed and wishing I had stuck to my original plan of going to Perla's. I will give them a star for bringing my client some wonderful ""Drunken"" donuts infused with vodka and a nice tequila caramel sauce (they sure like drunk food here). However, I'm afraid I won't be returning until I hear they get their act together. The good news is I plan to make it up to my client and take him to either Perry's for pork chops or Perla's.",3.0 star rating
"I came here with a friend about a year ago and, in a sure sign of an amazing restaurant, haven't been able to stop thinking about it since then. It wasn't so much the service or the food as everything put together...the service, the food, the ambience...For starters we had the charcuterie board...which was totally different and tasted amazing from start to finish. I'm normally not a big fan of charcuterie (sorry it's true) but this one was freaking delicious. It comes with ""country pâté, lamb sweet bread terrine, boudin and thüringer sausage"" - and I cannot recommend it enough.

"Have dined there on five occasions.  Each time was a hit.  Beautiful space, great staff and food and awesome people watching.  This last time exceeded all previous times.  Since the menu had no vegetarian entrees, I aske the waitperson if the kitchen could do a gluten free, vegetarian dish.  Without hesitation she said ""Yes"" and went on to ask what vegetable I wanted.  When the plate came out it blew me away.  Not only was it really good but the chef must also be a visual artist.  The arrangement, colors and textures were like a painting.Also, this is one of the prettiest W Hotels I have been in.",4.0 star rating

For the price is was very mediocre.  When I spend $300+ on a meal it should be complete.  It felt very incomplete and not satisfying.   At half the price this restaurant would be acceptable.  There are so many upper scale dining options in Austin I would not come back.,2.0 star rating
"I recently took my husband to Trace for his birthday for an early dinner before going to a concert at ACL Live.  Another couple joined us.  After we had been seated for about 10 minutes, the hostess noticed that we had not been waited on so she came over and apologized and took our drink orders.  That's the sign of a great hostess as most just seat you and forget about you.  Once our server got started with us he turned out to be excellent.  He really knew the wine list and made excellent recommendations.I had the beet salad (exceptional) followed by the crab cakes (good - just a little under-seasoned).  My husband had the halibut (great).  Our friends had the burger and fries (loved it).  Note that the plates are small which is ok with us, but if you are really hungry you might want to order additional sides or the burger.We returned after the concert for a cocktail and the hostess recognized us as we walked in and sat us in the bar and had a server take excellent care of us.  Of note:  we were very happy to see people dressed nicely.  Austinites here looked chic!",4.0 star rating

"Went there for a party. It's a small restaurant and bar located in downtown W hotel. The food is a little bit pricey due to the high location cost. We ordered 10 kinds of appetizers. Several are olive based. My favorite appetizer is tuna tartare. My favorite entree is the fish, I don't remember it's halibut or trout. It's very tender.The frog leg dish only has two legs. Hard to split at a group party.The drinks are all $10 above per glass. Among all the cocktails, the blueberry based drink is the best.",3.0 star rating
"Its pretty good. Definitely looks good. The decor is grown and sexy. Would you expect anything less? Probably not. The menu is of course a bit pricey. We came for lunch and had salads.

"Hmmnm, I read the reviews and then wasn't sure what restaurant those people went to.  We headed here before an ACL show and found it to be quite enjoyable.So, 1st the easy:  The decor is fun.  it's a bit crazy, but I enjoyed looking at it.  I felt very 'pimp-ette' and cool.  Now the bit more difficult:  The food.  Food is such a personal experience, but our's was pretty delicious.  To start:  We ordered the 'Market Snacks: A Large Sampling of the Season's Bounty'.  It was fun to say the least.  Enough for 3-4 people.  I mean fried olives?!?  Heck yeah!  I love olives, so this was just up my alley.  It also had green beans in a sauce, some corn fritter things, and regular olives I believe.  (I had a few yummy drinks, so memory little fuzzy).  Just make sure to let the fried items cool before eating!  These suckers are HOT!  We pigged out (read: burned our tongues) on that, then our orders came.My guy: Spring Rabbit Stew.  Actually quite yummy, and I am not preferential to the ""what's up Doc?"" variety.  It's presentation alone won me over.  Really hard to describe it, but it was good.Me:  Frisee and Duck Confit Salad.  The 2 hour egg is nothing special, just literally cooked for 2 hours.  It was ok.  I wish I had known or paid attention, the Hoisin sauce (guess that's what they're calling Sherry Vinaigrette) was dominating the dish.  It wasn't bad, but I like my sauces on the lighter side, if at all.  Good, just ask for that sauce on the side probably.  Tasted like a combined version of 'crispy duck' from a real Chinese restaurant.  (which is my favorite, ask my guy, he knows how much I've sought after the perfect version)My Buddha Buddy:  Spring Risotto.  It was pretty good.  But I'm not a risotto fan by any stretch of anyone's imagination.  I thought the seasoning's were a bit heavy on this one.Drinks:  I had a cucumber jalapeño creation, it was ok.  I thought it was too much cucumber.  So, for the next one, I ordered a regular Mex. martini.  It was good, no complaints.  Prices are a little crazy, but what I expect for downtown and being in the W.Would go back, I enjoyed it enough the 1st time.",4.0 star rating

"Atmosphere: very hip and a little bit upscale. I wouldn't imagine anyone coming here with jeans and a t-shirt, although I'm sure they'd allow it. It's a bit dimly lit so it gave off a more romantic, intimate vibe....or an upscale, swaggy kind of vibe (depends on who you're with?)Service: our server came by at the right moments and I never had to wait for anything.  She wasn't pushy and didn't leave us alone for long periods of time. IMO, that's GREAT service!Food: I thought the sushi was good but wasn't anything particularly memorable about it. The happy hour prices are great ($6-$8 sushi rolls). My favorite dishes were the appetizers we got...dynamite mussels and fried tofu.Drinks: I ordered the cosmo for my beverage. It wasn't strong at all...if anything, a little on the too sweet side of things. Will probably skip on this order next time.Overall: this place is great for groups or romantic outings. Between the three of us, we ordered 4 rolls, 2 appetizers, and 3 drinks....all for $55 ($66 with tip). A little on the pricier side of things for a ""happy hour"", especially at $22 per person.

"I like it. But when the tab came I liked it less. So ordering off the reverse HH menu I noticed coconut sake 8$, sounds like it's worth a try. I ordered with spicy edamame. I was asked "" in the small or large bottle?"" Large of course, thinking it was the 10oz carafe. It came out in a 22oz labeled Ty Ku flavored sake bottle. Tasted sweet enough. So we, my party, consumed it rather rapidly. While we were shooting up, we ate calamari, regular edamame, spicy edamame, and a baked mussels dish. I ordered a Chi roll for me and cucumber avocado roll for my date. The evening went well. The ambiance is a bit dark but wasn't loud like the other reverse HH I've been to. So the check comes. Scrolling the prices. 8. 8. 4.5. 39. 5.....whoa wait back up. 39? For what? Sakeeeeeeeeeeee!!! Lost a star for no description or price on menus. At least for HH menu. I noticed it in the drink menu after paying. My 20$ HH dinner turned into a 63$ fiasco. That sake was twice the price spent on dinner. I only mention this because the HH menu showed other flavors at 6/8 for sm/Lg so I was expecting maybe 16. NOT 39$. I'll return. Just to read the full menu fully.",3.0 star rating
"Just ate and drank here. good late night happy hour selection. Service was a little bit off (they forgot to give us utensils and plates until we asked and a plate that we had ordered) but overall not bad, given the hour. we ordered the California roll, the scallion, and the chi roll which were a bit a small but the taste and quality was ok. Not a bad spot if you're dowtown late and want some reasonably priced food.",4.0 star rating
"4 stars is completely for the Happy Hour, as I haven't been for the regular priced menu. The rolls I had (Austin & Chi) were very good for the price (around $8.) I would say the star of happy hour has to be the appetizers though. They have tons of little delicious eats for under $4!This is a great place for late night too - we went here on a Saturday night and it was CRAZY PACKED! We sat at the bar which was fun, but this place is not quiet. It's more of a huge groups of drunk party people! This is probably not helped by the great happy hour bar menu :) Anyway, it's nice to be in a louder, rowdier, modern sushi place if it's going to be past 10 pm and you're drinking!From the website: Happy Hours Mon. to Sat. 3pm-7pm Sun. all day Reverse Happy Hours Thurs. 10pm-12am Fri. & Sat. 10pm-1:30am",4.0 star rating

"Came here a few ones for reverse happy hour on weekends (10pm-2am Thu-Sat). The hostess seated us right away and we were able to order within 5 min of siting down. We ordered a bunch of appetizers including be Agadashi tofu, the edamame, calamari as well as a few rolls. The Agadashi tofu was surprisingly my favorite appetizer because the tofu were cut into large squares and the serving size was bigger than the Agadashi tofu I had at other places. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce was flavorful and gave the tofu a good kick. The sushi rolls were pretty good but I've had better because the fish they place into the rolls are a little small. We ordered the lychee and watermelon martinis as well as the lychee sake the lychee martini was pretty strong, the watermelon was okay. The lychee sake however was delicious and pretty cheap since it was during happy hour. Overall a good experience, good music, good vibes, fast and friendly service.",4.0 star rating

"HORRIBLE!! Came here for friend's birthday dinner. Everybody's appetizers salads and main entrees came at different times. I got my carpaccio (appetizer) after my salad and was not very good...ordered filet mignon medium well and came already sliced but was pretty much rare ( which is completely  opposite of what I ordered and came with bunch of stuff that I don't eat (sushi). I will not be dining here again. I am really disappointed in both the service and the ability to cook my order correctly. Now all of the other people I am with have eaten and I am still waiting for them to bring back the steak that I had to send back. Well I got it returned only to find that most of the meat had not been recooked and was still basically very rare (cut and was lots of pink) so I will not pay for incompetence.  Probably one of my worst dining experiences. Was not offered or asked for anything to replace the dinner that I was not going to have sent back a third time. And no manager has come to table to apologize or anything.I spoke with a manager after this experience before leaving the restaurant, and no surprise, no apology or empathy.

"I just want to start off by saying that this place has pretty decent sushi and fish quality, but there is a lot of hype. And unfortunately, Uchi does not match the hype that it receives. I went to Uchi during the middle of the week with a reservation. However, my party and I were still waiting for our reserved table for quite a while. The point of a reservation is so that you don't have to wait for very long when you get to a restaurant. And I promise you that we did not arrive late. The seating arrangement at Uchi doesn't really give you a sense of comfort. The tables seem to be placed a little close together and the noise level is above average. It can be difficult to hear your friends when they are right next to you. So, just be warned that it may be hard to hear your companions. While there are interesting pairings of flavors for the fish, sometimes the flavors seem overwhelming. For example, we had a sashimi fish that had some type of citrus garnishes. While the quality of the fish was definitely of high quality, the citrus was too overpowering and kind of ruined the dish in my opinion. While this is a luxury restaurant, the prices for what we receive are definitely overpriced. The presentation and the quality were pretty darn good, but the price was not justified for the taste. Also, while the foie gras nigiri was good, it just doesn't work in my opinion. So, I would skip this if I were you. The rice and seaweed just do not compliment the delicate flavor of foie gras. Lastly, our server definitely treated my group like children. While we may look young (asian genes), I'm definitely a full-grown adult. I realize that it seemed like we were ordering a lot, but I can assure you that we are able to pay for what we order. After every order of sushi we made, the waiter seemed to always take the menu away from us. And we would have to continuously ask for it back. It got to a point where it was a little bit annoying. But, we just went along with it. While I do think coming to Uchi was an interesting experience, I'm not sure if it is exactly worth it. The price was inexplicably high, unique flavors are not always a good thing, and the atmosphere is not super comfortable.",2.0 star rating
Favorite sushi place in Austin. Tonight was my second time there. Wonderful customer service. Every server has a smile on there face. It's just a wonderful energy at this restaurant.

"This was an incredible experience!  My husband and I are from San Francisco and Uchi was highly recommended to us.  Both of us were pleasantly surprised about how good our meal and overall experience was.  We have had some amazing sushi meals in SF and throughout our travels and Uchi was right up there at the top of our favorites list.  Our server, Mandy, was so knowledgable and friendly.  When we first sat down everything on the menu looked so good that we couldn't decide.  Together with Mandy we came up with the perfect menu for us.  Every bite was exquisite and our Sake paired perfectly with everything.  The fish was so fresh and full of flavor. There was not one dish that we ordered that we didn't like and the dessert was wonderful too!We felt like Uchi was a Texas take on sushi.  The flavors were so creative and delicious.  The restaurant decor was perfect and our meal from start to finish was delightful.  We would highly recommend Uchi to anyone we know that enjoys sushi and is visiting Austin.  We hope to go back again soon.  Mandy, thank you for making our experience even better!!",5.0 star rating

"Being from seattle I consider myself lucky to have access to fresh fish. Apparently this place has access to fresh fish as well.

Ask your server for advice. Nolan, was superb and helped us enjoy a perfect meal. Worth the wait and even a return trip to Austin.",5.0 star rating
Went back to Uchi after not having been back in 9 years since the last review I wrote. My server was Heather and she gave me and my friend an incredible dining experience! She gave several complimentary dishes to make up for the bad experience 9 years ago and they were all delicious. She checked in on us often and her food and drink suggestions were all on point.

"I'm not sure I can add much to the 1700+ reviews and 1800+ photos except to join the chorus of praise.  This was not our first experience here but it was indeed memorable.  My husband and I celebrated with our twins for their birthday.  Uchi really made it special for them and we enjoyed the delicious courses, a bottle of really great Pinot noir and a smart and attentive server and experience guide.Our reservations were for a Monday night @ 9:00 in November .  I thought we might be closing the place down when I booked that time.  I needn't have worried, it was packed and full of energy until our departure at nearly 11:00.  Our server navigated us thru the menu pointing out his favorites, specials and their best sellers.  Each dish was so carefully created and plated.  Their food is not inexpensive by any measure but what they're doing is really on another level from anything else I've experienced in Austin.  Thank you , Uchi, for helping our twins ring in #24!",5.0 star rating

"Does Uchi really need another 5 star review?  YES, THEY DO, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE BEST.We manage to go to Uchi at least once a year, and each time I am amazed at the food and service they present.We went last night for my lady's birthday, our third in a row here, and it was hands down one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  We were seated at the sushi bar, which at this point, I will probably choose to only ever sit at the sushi bar from now on because it was so fun.  Our sushi chef and order taker was Yoshi (1 of 2 Yoshis, look for the yellow Yoshi, and chill out, it's not a racist thing, see my photo) and he was absolutely phenomenal. He made great recommendations for items on AND off the menu.  He made much better choices for us than we made for ourselves.  He also made us some of his signature sashimi and they were some of the best tasting bites of food ever to touch my mouth.  I do have to say, the rib dish was the only let down. I would not recommend that (it was a choice we made, not Yoshi).  Everything else we ordered (and given) was spectacular.  I was sad they stopped making the fried green tomatoes though... Bring those back!The service at Uchi is also top notch.  Everyone working here is friendly, attentive, seem happy, and create a great vibe.  Now I wouldn't expect any less with the prices you pay at Uchi, but they are truly providing top notch service.So there you go!  Don't come here expecting a cheap meal and then complain about it.  It's expensive, but you're paying for what I would say is the best food in Austin, and some of the best in the world.Peace and love to everyone at Uchi",5.0 star rating

"It's the noisiest Japanese restaurant in my life.  Uchi is overrated in yelp.  The food is small size, I am fine with small plates as long as they are delicious.  However, Uchi is in the opposite way.  I ordered half price Karage, it tastes just mediocre.  I have tried some really good karage in other Japanese restaurants.  My standards of judging a good Karage are: whether they have crispy cover and tender chicken thighs.  Uchi's is just so so.  Tempura shrimp tastes good, but I found the black    shrimp line is still there.  I was shocked when I saw this black thing since it should be cleared up!  The Wagyu kimchi roll tastes werid.... I have high expectations on this meal but I am so disappointed.  The service is great but I don't think it's worthy of it since the expensive price and mediocre food quality.",3.0 star rating

"This small gem in downtown Austin is a must if you like great authentic Italian food! I ordered the eggplant Parmesan which was truly awesome! Many multiple layers of super thin eggplant fried but not breaded gave this a delicious flavor without the heaviness. I couldn't eat it all in one sitting so I am savoring it again tonight! The spinach salad had a deliciously tangy dressing that wasn't overwhelming. The other members of my family had the two different lasagna dishes and they said they were also delicious. The tiramisu was also amazing! The waitstaff was super friendly and patiently answered any questions we had about the menu. I give this 4.5 stars only because the seating wasn't very comfortable, but they are getting ready to expand so I expect this will improve.  The atmosphere was casual with TVs in the corners and a sizable bar.

"Having Italian food in Texas is usually a different experience from having Italian food in the northeast (or in Italy for that matter).  It's hard to match the quality of the ingredients, the flavors and the selection of dishes in an area with a high number of Italian people.  Numero 28 is Italian food for Italian people.  The people working at the restaurant are Italian.  The food is authentically Italian.  During our recent visit, the large group sitting at the table next to us was speaking Italian.The venue is a small corner location at street level near Republic Square, the Austin Music Hall, Violet Crown and Ballet Austin.  It has both inside and outside seating.  Inside seating is more intimate but because of the small venue, it can be rather warm on the inside space.  Many of the reviews recommend the pizza.  Austin, the home of many universities, has lots of good pizza places.  For a first trip to Numero 28, I would recommend trying the other dishes that are more unique to a finer Italian ristorante.We started with the Crocchette di patate e mozzarella along with the Carpaccio di manzo.  The crocchette was delicious-  a lightly fried mix of potato and mozzarella.  It was a nice combination with the fresh greens in the Mista tre colori salad.For the main course, we had the Pollo ala griglia and Porchetta.  The pollo was a bit bland- there's not much that can be done with a grilled chicken breast.   Fortunately,  the roasted potatoes had a wonderful crispiness and were very tasty.  The porchetta was very good.For dessert,  our biggest challenge was deciding which of the five choices to try- all of the desserts sounded wonderful.  We had the Semifreddo al torrone and the Torta al Ciccolato.  Both were superb. Pros:  ample choices of traditional Italian dishes, fresh ingredients, well-prepared meals in a truly Italian restaurant.  It was an intimate dining experience- very easy to carry on a conversation without ambient noise, unruly children or intrusive televisions (it may be louder on weekends, though).Cons: downtown location (ugh- parking!), very small seating area that heated up quickly because of the proximity to the oven,   The food was a bit slow coming out of the kitchen, so keep this in mind if you're planning on attending an event at the nearby Music Hall.  It would not be a good choice for a very large group- it would be a good choice for 2 people up to 4 people.  The restaurant also serves gelato, so it would make a nice quick late night stop for coffee and gelato after seeing a show.Because of the small size of the restaurant, you may want to consider reservations at peak times.",4.0 star rating
"Must have been the ultimate off-night of off-nights, considering the other reviews here. Bad food, bad service, bad atmosphere.My friend's baked ziti arrived ten minutes before my other friend's lasagna, which arrived ten minutes before my eggplant. That's an awkward 20 minute gap between the first plate and the last. And what did I wait for? A cold, unappetizing glob of red on top of a cheap plastic plate. The overriding texture on all three plates was mushy, the flavors were basic, and nothing seemed particularly fresh.Also, what is with the weird off-the-shelf cabinets above all the bench seating?",1.0 star rating
"I like pizza, wine and attractive waiters. Numero 28 enables me to enjoy all of these in one perfectly ambient setting. On quick lunch date, my boyfriend (begrudingly, because, usually, if his pizza isn't buried in a mile high crust of buttery dough- he's skeptical at best, but typically reverts to the behaviors of a 5 year old who's just been told to finish his bowl of mushy peas) and I popped into this quaint, little sidewalk joint on west 2nd. We started with some drinks- Saint Arnold IPA for him and their newly tapped rose for myself (which paired oh-so-nicely with the cheesy Bianca del Diavolo). My (handsome - you should know) boyfriend had the yin to my pizza yang, the red Diavola, which he sincerely enjoyed despite the fact that I talked about ex boyfriends and why Superman II circa 1980 changed my life, while he tried to enjoy his pizza. We capped off our lunch with a shot of espresso. And if you pryed the pizza and wine from my chubby, territorial little fingers (which, by the way, you should never do to a hungry and thirsty woman), the espresso alone would keep me here.  Almost too hot to drink, rich and strong, thich dark crema. Yum-mo. I recommend Numero 28, and the fabuloso, Andre, without reservation. They don't do much marketing, they let the experience of customers speak for itself, so I'm spreaking-- do yourself a favor and check it out.",5.0 star rating

"I heard mostly Italian spoken by the waitstaff and owner/ manager prior to ordering and receiving my food.  This was a promising sign that did not dissappoint!I ordered the ceasar salad (classic and good) and the Numero 28 pizza. The Numero 28 was a white pizza with mushrooms, prusciutto, and truffle cream sauce.  They had me a truffle cream sauce.  And oh my crust!  The crust was classically Naples style, so fresh it almost crawled off the plate.  The mushrooms were also very fresh.  They were juicy (I know- that sounds weird) and had this fresh but al dente cooked crunch when you bit into them on the pizza that was a sign of a perfectly cooked pie.  My family in Brooklyn would be impressed.  I would perhaps consider taking them here next time rather than HomeSlice or Bufalina (blaspemy, I know!).They have a newly added outdoor front area that is great in nice weather- if you don't mind that insanity that is the constant Seaholm construction that will last a few years in that area.

"A solid 4 star rating here for several reasons - First the food. I highly recommend the Numero 28. Speck, mushrooms, truffle cream - awesome! It's also a white pizza, which is my preferred pizza style. The crust was thin, had good char and had great texture. I did miss some of the ""smokiness"" that usually comes with a wood oven though.Second, service was great. The servers were delightful and on top of things. Call me a sucker, but I liked our server's Italian accent! Are we in Italy? He recommended that two of us share an 18 inch pizza, even though we were leaning towards a large 29 inch..... I was glad to not have to feel like we were getting upsold here. (Just a side note: the pizza's aren't round. So when you're trying to ""calculate"" (pi x r^2) how big of a pizza you're getting, it's not 18 inches across a circle, but rather 18 inches of an oblong oval)Third, the atmosphere. My wife and I were just going to grab some pizza to go after our workout at the gym. But the guys were convinced us to eat in and welcomed us, despite us being in our gym clothes. I'm glad we did. The space is pleasant and intimate.Take note: they carry Dolce Neve gelato. We were too full after our delicious pizza, but I could see myself stopping in for a scoop (or two...) of gelato.As you probably are already aware, parking's a big hassle - but it's Second street oh well.",4.0 star rating

"Bernardo and Marco were my Valentines this year. What hospitality. What Italian. I had a downtown concert that night, so I researched nearby places to grab food. There was no grabbing, nor was there simply food. There was an Italian dinner experience I've missed since a family trip there last year. Italian food is not the large, pasta-forward barges we're used to seeing in Italian-American chains. No, no. It's instead multi-course dinners of which pasta is merely a small precursor, and simple is the name of the game. The food is simple but so amazing, because the quality of ingredients is so outstanding. And so it is that I walk in and seat myself at the bar, immediately greeted by the warm gaze of Marco. I heard there was Dolce Neve gelato. I see the coveted pistacchio gelato + cafe affogato, espresso, whites, reds, beer and prosecco on tap. I get comfortable.Marco asks what I'd like to drink, and after some of my deliberating mentions there is prosecco on tap. Decision made. Looking over the menu, Bernardo finishes an involved conversation with a couple in the back and says hello. We learn a bit about each other, and I learn a great deal about the restaurant's pizza ovens and the Italian operator who will be flying in to train others how to use their brand-new electric convection ovens. These ovens are so state of the art that they require special care and attention. I myself require special care and attention, I totally get you there Bernardo. I ask so many questions, he and Marco send over their Caponata con Crostini. It is lovely, and so is my prosecco. I order the seared tuna atop a bed of cous cous. It is delicious.I chat with other regulars seated at the bar and thoroughly enjoy the Owners v. Regulars banter that ensues all around me. I feel like family. I see their cafe affogato option and make the difficult decision to forego pistacchio for my next visit in favor of Marco bringing a single scoop of vanilla gelato in a glass and handing me the espresso to pour over the gelato myself. I can't have some until I snap a picture of it and send it to my dad, who loves all things gelato related and authentic Italian, which Numero 28 is in spades. I ask for the bill in Italian, the upper limit of my command of the language, and thank Marco, Bernardo, and the wait staff for a whimsical evening. Ben fatto, Numero 28.I cannot stop thinking about the pizza I will destroy next I come on my Authentic Italian Manifesto (AIM), with company next time! I foresee a Berries gathering, oh yes. Get ready for the best of bantering, Marco & Bernardo!",4.0 star rating
"This place was DELICIOUS! At first I was skeptical about it since I've been to sushi places that just weren't that good, but this place blew me away! The atmosphere was really relaxing and had a jazzy feel to it. It made me feel like I was on vacation. Of course not being familiar with the place I ordered my usual Cali roll which was excellent, but my aunt ordered the hot roll. That was the BEST roll I have ever had in my life!

"The sushi is pretty good and the fish is very fresh. I hit them up one night and really enjoyed it.Went back a few weeks later with some friends and it happened tp be happy hour and they were not nearly as nice as when I went there during dinner hours. They definitely had a bit of an attitude. I assume because it was cheap sushi time, they didnt have to be nice to you, screw them. It was probably the best deal when it comes to a happy hour I have been to, but their crappy attitude sucked. I will not be back again, thats for sure, I dont acre how cheap it is. If you dont want to sell the sushi cheaper, dont have happy hour.EDIT: OK, I went back with some friends and they were totally cool during happy hour and the sushi was great. Must have been having a bad day the time before. Been back various times since and all has been great.",4.0 star rating
"Misleading customers is uncool....  Umi is a decent place to get sushi. I have been there multiple times and enjoyed my meals. However, I have a problem with a restaurant that advertises Happy Hour until 6:30 when last call is actually 6:20.  We walked in yesterday about 6:15 and were seated at 6:20. We inquired about the Happy Hour specials and were told by our waitress we were too late for happy hour because the clock on the register is fast! Are you kidding me?! The chalkboard at the entrance specifically stated 6:30. I suggest you change the chalkboard or fix the clock on the register (can't be hard). We had already ordered soup so we ate it and left. I will not be going back to a restaurant that misleads its customers especially when they are fully aware of the problem. There are plenty of good sushi restaurants in Austin.

"I went to Umi last night around 8, the place was completely empty; I have actually been going there for over two years and everytime I go there are fewer people. Maybe the food has gone down hill. It seems odd to complain about miso soup at a sushi restaurant (who notices the miso soup), but it really wasn't that good. It looked like it was from a cheap packet. The chicken was terrible, like stale bits of soggy cargboard. The california rolls were okay, and the sashimi was fine, but nothing to write home about it. Everything seemed a little stale, a little under the weather, and just slightly below average. On the plus side, they do have mochi there, it just tastes like it has been in the freezer for months. I don't know if mochi can go bad, but after having this, I wouldn't be surprised. I've gone before and it's been slighty better, but there are definitely better sushi places out there.",2.0 star rating
"Umi is a relaxing sushi bar on Austin's south side just off 35.  The atmosphere is actually very nice and on the weekend there is always a crowd.  I've never made reservations or had to wait so I'm not sure how all that works.  What I do know is that the sushi is definitely above average and I usually eat the rolls or tempura when I go there.  Its definitely more laid back than Kenichi or Uchi and a lot less of a hit on your wallet.  If you want to have a laid back sushi experience this is the place to be.  Last weekend we ate there and had a full meal and drinks for about $65.  Definitely worth your time and money as well as a great place for drinks, sake, and people watching.",3.0 star rating

"I have to first say that I am a food snob, so please forgive me Umi Sushi if I am a little harsh on you, I went to Umi Sushi for Christmas dinner and I must say that they dissappointed me severely and practically ruined Christmas altogether. There were a total of 3 tables with patrons (maybe 8 people total in the restaurant) and 5 Sushi chefs standing around behind their enormous Sushi bar. One thing that bothered me about this place it that they werent particularly friendly, our waitress was very stern and didnt smile the entire time. I know what you might say maybe its a culture thing but it really isnt, I have alot of  Asian friends and they are really good at making me feel welcomed. So that aside lets talk about the food, I was really dissappointed with the calamari which was not really good and the portion size was small for the price. The California Rolls and Tuna rolls I ordered were cold and tasted pre-made, and this really is a problem for me because if I wanted premade rolls I would have gone to a grocery store and bought some. I was furthermore turned off because their more expensive rolls (10 dollars and up) were actually pretty good and the rice tasted fresh. This made my other rolls taste even worst. I ordered a variety of rolls and sushi so it really bothered me, that even with an empty restaurant  the chefs couldnt make my Cali rolls and Tuna rolls from scratch even on Christmas day? What gives where oh where is your sense of customer service? All in all I would never return to Umi Sushi, they are a bit pricey for the quality of food. Honestly there are alot of other sushi restaurants here in Austin within the same price range with alot better quality food and customer service.",1.0 star rating

We got ceviche that was not ceviche - it was yellowtail sashimi (the only thing that tasted very good), but again not ceviche, as it was just raw fish in sauce with avocado, nothing else. Then we got queso, which was a melted cheese with onions. Maybe this is the real queso but did not enjoy it at all. Drinks were just ok. Oh and EVERYTHING comes with tortillas, even queso. The only time service was good was when they were picking up the check. Extremely overpriced for very very average food. Not coming back.",2.0 star rating
"I'm sooo not impressed with La Condesa. I've been two times for lunch, both at the urging of friends or coworkers. I was definitely unimpressed with my $15 greasy torta, but since it was on a friend's Austin restaurant bucket list I gave the place another try.We ate at the bar and the service was really good for as busy as it was at lunch. I ordered the pork shoulder tacos, but the bartender told me they were ""super spicy,"" and urged me to try the steak tacos instead. So I did. But like, if something is SO spicy that the waitress is recommending that someone who likes spicy things order something else, maybe the kitchen should consider toning down the heat.But the dish was a MESS. $13 for two tacos on regular-old-out-of-the-bag-close-to-stale corn tortillas topped with some fatty pieces of overcooked steak and greasy, almost burnt fried onion straws. Completely dry with no sauce or salsa provided.And the rice and beans were absolutely atrocious. The refried black beans were devoid of any salt, herbs, or seasoning. I'm assuming all of the salt was reserved for the mush they called rice. I mixed the rice and beans together and everything kind of balanced out.All in all, super disappointed considering the prices and hype for this place.",1.0 star rating

"I went here with my girlfriend for a date night, we got great parking in the garage right by the restaurant, the parking did cost 15 dollars but I cant complain because it was right by the restaurant.As we rounded the corner and walked into La Condesa the first thing I noticed was that it seemed incredibly dark, now I get mood lighting and understand having the lights "" dim "" can be sort of romantic but it seemed insanely dark. The waiters didn't seem to be tripping over each other and dim lighting is hardly a big deal so I focused all my attention on the menu. The Tacos are a bit pricey but they seem to be made with only the best ingredients. My girlfriend and I got the COCHINITA PIBIL , ARÁBICOS and the EL CALIFA so that we could share and have one of each. We also ordered the ELOTES, I am a big fan of Elotes and had heard that this is an incredible version of the Mexican classic.The ELOTES was not a disappointment, its covered in cheese and some sort of chili powder that tastes like it is infused with lime. It may be the best corn I have ever eaten, the cheese and and everything on the corn go together so well its like a grilled corn dance party in your mouth.The tacos were excellent, though all of them were plays on classic street taco's they were very unique and unlike anything I have had before. The cabbage and pickled red onion on the COCHINITA PIBIL provided a deliscious contrast to the roasted pork. The pickled cucumber on the ARABICOS blended deliciously with the venison and bacon fat tortilla. For me however the crispy manchego cheese made the EL CALIFA the real winner for the evening, every bite of sharp cooked cheese made every bite of  rare juicy beef taste better than I would have ever thought possible. La Condesa is great! I cant say enough good things about it, bring a date and enjoy!",4.0 star rating
Ran across this place as a surprise from our niece from Florida. We met there as a convenience to her while she was in town to have margaritas. The margaritas are awesome!!

"Knowing that pizza and Mexican food is by far the cheapest restaurant food to produce and turn a profit, I'm awarding La Condesa four stars. Beans, rice, formerly cheap cuts of meat ala fajita can mean big business and that's what you have to charge in a downtown setting like Austin. Starting with cocktails, one of the worst mojitos I've ever had. Something about the drink was bitter; having made them at home many times I rarely find one that doesn't have simple syrup. Redemption did come fast when I ordered the El Cubico. OMG, tobacco infused tequila, vanilla infused brandy, grilled pineapple juice, lemon...Its the first description ever for me that mentioned volcanic anything.The food emphasized upscale street foods turned out to be well; how do you say bomb diggity in Spanish? The Mexican street corn was done up right as was the conchinita pibil taco. The guacamole tasting paired unique ingredients that produced vibrant flavors until the last bites were consumed. I'm also a sucker for huitlacoche which is hard to find these days short of a $30 a plate interior establishment. La Condesa even at happy hour prices provided small plates created with love. Service was good as well as the people watching downtown. A nice date for the wife and I. Christine, my pants sadly stayed on...at the restaurant",4.0 star rating

"This is an odd one. It was really overall good but I am somehow called to report it as just ""OK"". It was a Friday night at 7:30ish. The food is very good. High quality ingredients for the most part.I will say the #1 thing that has me saying I will not return is this, after a long week on a Friday night I wanted my favorite Tequila in a simple straight-sided rocks glass to sip with a cold beer. I know costs, I know spirits, etc, etc, and after the server acted like I was ordering something from outer space because I didn't want their contrived little wood plate gimmick with a shot of the tequila, shot of the Clamato (or whatever the serve) and limes (what is this, 1985?)...I was served the tiniest most pathetic pour I have ever seen...like ever seen...and hit for $14. That was nonsense and a terrible way to set the stage.Next weird and totally surprising thing, the chips were like they came out of a bag. Really surprised when such a simple thing can make such a big impression. Other than that, everything that came out was very tasty and well prepared.Guac tasting - Good but tiny ramequins of the salsas was irritating. Two of them were so close in flavor profile as to be hard to distinguish from one another. The guac itself was good but essentially just a little plop with three different 'toppings'. Nothing that impressive and for something like $18....huh? Wish I owned this joint...awesome food costs for sure.I think this is the issue. Yes, good to great flavors (Hamachi Ceviche truly awesome!) but very expensive for what you receive. Feels like a place trying too hard to ""elevate"" dishes. Putting things in a ""small plate"" presentation and charging crazy prices may impress the hipster-ish kids that seem to pack every place in this town and spend like they all have huge trust funds (once again the California-effect no doubt), but while I'm typically not at all price sensitive, for some reason this place struck an annoying chord. Not a Per Se (NYC) chord sort of thing where you go-in knowing you will have 15 thimbles of micro-greens for $800/plate but still sort of weird considering what it is.Oh, our server was only fair as she clearly wanted to turn the table. We had no plans of hanging around but from the moment we sat down, it was a go-go-go pace without a chance to breathe.Otherwise, nice space and very good food overall...but not a place to which I'd go back. They really blew it with the Tequila and service right out of the gate. BTW - three dollar signs? Hmmm.Have fun...",3.0 star rating

I usually don't like to give a bad review but this time I feel I must. My husband and I and another couple had dinner here. The service was super slow (waited 45 minutes to order) and the food was not good at all. I ordered their special which was a mushroom quesadilla.  I wouldn't feed my dog this thing. It was stale like and very strange tasting. Not good at all. And it was $16!  My friend had the same thing and agreed. The tacos were not good either per her husband.  The chile relleno looked like a little salad $18. We also had their chips and guacamole. Nothing special. At least they were edible. Their Classico margaritas were $10 each and not much tequila in them. I just don't get this restaurant. Upscale bad Mexican food is all I can say. I agree with some of the reviewers.

"Went for brunch, food was a good portion size for the price. I got the huevos rancheros and my friend got the chilaquiles. The flavor was pretty solid with each but the texture was a little off (soggy tortillas). Good atmosphere though and overall fairly tasty brunch.",4.0 star rating
"So underwhelmed that I'm writing this review while sitting in the restaurant. This place was on a couple different lists of Tex Mex restaurants to try while in Austin. I'm wondering if anorexic models with no taste buds put those lists together. The portions are small. And I mean SMALL! The food is fine. Not good. Not bad. Just fine. So what did we get? Well, my friends and I ordered a $12 guacamole to start. We didn't mind the price. We live in Manhattan. We're accustomed to paying a premium price. But we expect a premium meal in exchange. Usually a $12 guacamole starter comes in one of those stone bowl situations. You all know the one. Not so at La Condesa. Here, they bring you a little tea cup (no joke) for a table of four to share. The real kicker? It wasn't fresh. It had very obviously been prepared as part of a larger batch rather than being made to order. Thumbs WAY down. I wasn't terribly hungry, so a friend and I asked the waiter if the salad was shareable. He said yes. We ordered one. When it arrived, we sat for a minute waiting for the other plate, assuming they split it for us in the kitchen. But no, fellow Yelpers. The portion was just absurd for sharing. Even amongst two people who didn't want much to begin with. So we ordered another one. For the record, the entire salad was comprised of a fistful of lettuce, a few scattered tomatoes, sprinkled cheese on top, and after a scavenger hunt, I managed to find some tiny pieces of jicama and avocado mixed in. Are they sure they can spare it?The only reason for two stars rather than one is because the servers were perfectly nice, everything came out quickly, yadda, yadda, yadda. Skip this place.",2.0 star rating
"Order the Spicy bacon sandwich. Hearty pieces of bacon, fried (slightly runny) egg, and avocado on a slightly sweet thick roll. Delicious. Supposedly there's a ""spicy"" sauce on it but I didn't taste anything all that spicy.The coffee was EH. I ordered a large iced cold brew and wasn't all that impressed. However, my friend ordered the iced tea and was very pleased. Downtown Jo's is a order first, take a number, have a seat (or leave) type of joint. The staff brings your order right to you. As a tourist, it was good place to hop in for breakfast.",3.0 star rating
"I've had to call it quits with this spot. Over half the times I've ordered food here, the order has been messed up and I don't actually get what I ordered.

"On a recent business trip to Austin, TX where my wife accompanied me, we had some time to explore the city on our first morning. We left our hotel in downtown, the Van Zandt, and after driving around a bit, we found a little area with a number of shops and cafes.  We decided to stop in for breakfast at Downtown Jo's Coffee Shop. You order inside and can decide to sit inside (air conditioned of course) or outside. We decided to enjoy outside seating as the morning wasn't too hot just yet on this July morning in Austin. I ordered the 2 egg plate, scrambled with American cheese and bacon with a large latte....  and it was delicious. The bacon in Austin is very different that what's typical in South Florida - it was cut thick and was very crispy and tasty. I think I like it more than the bacon back home!For a delicious, quick, and inexpensive bite for breakfast in downtown Austin, TX, Downtown Jo's Coffee Shop won't let you down.",3.0 star rating
"I must admit that I love this place; good coffee, good food, friendly staff, and a low-key setting make for a great way to start the day.Dine inside or outside, an you'll get the same great experience.  This is becoming my go to spot for breakfast, and it all comes down to the breakfast tacos.  Basically, anything with fried avocado is good, and in the case of the avocado, black bean & pico taco, this axiom holds true.  The potato, egg, & cheese is a great way to start the day as well.  Paired with piping hot Stumptown coffee, helpful, friendly service from behind the counter, and an un-rushed atmosphere, I'm always happy when I get here.In fact, the past two trips I was the first person at the door just before 7am.  Austinites are too cool to queue, so the short wait before they open the door is more like a gathering than a line, and that's ok.  There's no attitude on either side of the counter.",4.0 star rating

"As I stood out in the 28 degree January cold at 6:51am, the young women preoccupied with setting up inside nonchalantly ignored me.  At 6:55am the need to go to the bathroom increased, and the subsequent jumping up and down warmed me up a bit.  At 6:57am an employee knocked on the door.  She was let in while the co workers casually deliberated wether to let me in.  ""Are you ready?"" Someone said with care to cue their ability to open.  Well, it would've been nice if they would've let me in since I was freezing my balls off.  At 6:59 they sort of sarcastically held the door open with the solid embrace of their power.  I joyfully claimed a booth around 6:59am 20 seconds and then used the bathroom (3 stars).  I sat in the booth for a while and groggily realized it was counter service as they sort of absurdly and apathetically waited for me to approach. 7:10am - ""Do you have poached eggs?"" I inquired with the passivity of being emasculated. ""No we don't.""  And then she rambled off the obvious options on how to make an egg.""We can make them without butter.""Three strikes - I'm outta here.  I thought. I quickly headed toward the door. ""Later."" I heard some chick say, with some bass, an unsolicitous rebuff along the lines of ""yeah, get off our playground.""

Worst tuna melt of my life. I waited 30 mins for a luke warm 'tuna melt' with unmelted cheese on white soggy bread when I asked for sourdough. The melt was cut in half but when I tried to pull it apart it fell to soggy pieces. Also there is no silverware for patrons readily available - I had to ask and wait for some.

They quietly and contently stuff their faces full of pancakes and bacon while I have some time to shoot off some emails on their zippy wifi and down a strong and refreshing cold brew coffee.

"I came here on a Sunday after having brunch and walking around downtown. My friend I was with had been here (several times and knew the staff) and suggested we stop in to get a glass of wine and food for our friend who missed brunch. Upon arriving we were greeted delightfully by the owner and other employees. It was pretty empty as it was the odd time in between lunch and dinner. The restaurant is also not very large but they do have a nice outdoor area which adds additional space.Everyone was so nice and welcoming although they have thick accents (which I love) but makes it a little hard to understand. However, when they are so nice and cheery who really needs to understand what they are saying. I think the best part about the experience is the wine on tap! It was my first time seeing wine on tap aaaand a place having more wine on tap than beer.  I tried the prosecco which was fantastic! To go with this we were also given a starter which was some type of bruschette. Whatever it was it was very good. As for food we weren't super hungry but decided to order a pizza. Who am I to ever say no to pizza. we decided on the 18 inch rustica. My friend has also had the 29 inch pizza...holy pizza. I will note the pizza is more like flatbread type with the thin crust and more rectangle shape than circle. Regardless of the shape it is delicious! My friend had the meat lasagna and I, of course, tried some. No complaints from anyone on the lasagna.To end our experience we had one of the dessert wines. I never got the name of it. It was also good and sweet which was perfect for me. I'm looking forward to going back sometime to Numero 28! Great service and great food what is not to love!",5.0 star rating

They have a LOT of it, and they're really proud of the fact that most is on tap.

"What a pleasant surprise!I have to echo the reviewers that write Bernardo and Marco set the tone for a great experience with their hospitality. The food was excellent. Great taste with a homey feel. The Arancina vegetariana is hearty and rich. Ziti alla Norma is a great pasta dish, very flavorful. If you crave meat, the Porchetta is decadent-good. Amazingly, the potatoes in this dish stand out as well.I'm not a wine connoisseur, but I went with another reviewers recommendation on the Sicilian red. Not sure I was crazy about it, liked the Malbec better. Feel free to ignore my opinion on wine.Definitely go for the gelato. All we tried were good, but the pistachio was amazing. It tasted like fresh pistachios so much, I had to look and make sure I wasn't eating the shells.My apologies to the staff. I realized I miscalculated the tip. The good news is you gave me a lot of reasons to come back and make up for it.",5.0 star rating
"I stumbled across this gem on Yelp while looking for an Italian restaurant on Christmas Eve (bit of a tradition for me and my mom). It's in a great location downtown, and it being Xmas Eve, we had no issue with parking. When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by a charming Italian man named Bernardo who eagerly seated us by the window. There were not many people in the restaurant, but it was bright and cheerful (which perfectly describes our experience there).They have multiple wines on tap, which always interests me. The Sicilian red wine, coincidentally also the cheapest at $6/glass, sounded really interesting when Bernardo explained it (though I'm sure his accent could make the yellow pages sound interesting). He got us a sample and it was really good. They offer it by the glass as well as a small or large carafe. I meant to order the small, but he brought us the large 750ml instead (at $22, I wasn't going to complain - it was really tasty and I had a DD :). He brought us a complimentary appetizer, Caponata con crostini - stewed vegetables & olives in a tomato sauce served on toasted bread. It was delicious, and was so good with the wine. When it came time to order, Bernardo not only explained the dishes in detail, he also gave us a mini Italian lesson that was just adorable. He wasn't condescending, just sharing some tips and being a charming host (my mom ate it up).The arancini. You MUST get the arancini. I had always had it served as smaller rice balls, but apparently this is the authentic version. It was one larger disc (for lack of a better word). Perfectly crispy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside. The center was stuffed with meat and peas and it was absolutely delicious. In the future I plan on just going for arancini, wine and gelato.The Caprese salad was simple and tasty. Nothing very special, but good ingredients including a little roasted red pepper which I enjoyed. Then we had the vegetable lasagna. I'm not sure if it typically comes with red sauce underneath, but my mom mentioned she wanted red sauce and Bernardo assured her she would get it. The noodles were fresh, the flavors were decadent. We were so happy with our choices and completely stuffed. Until I remembered they had gelato from Dolce Neve! I walked over to the gelato cart and Bernardo was immediately at my side to assist me. He explained the flavors and gave me samples of his favorites. We landed on the Chocolate Hazelnut and he talked me into a large since we were splitting it, which was definitely the right decision. It was Christmas!The food was delicious, fresh, authentic Italian - not to mention very reasonably priced. Bernardo made us feel like part of his family. We couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. Highly recommend!",5.0 star rating

"I had a chance to try Numero 28 during my weekend in Austin and I was pleasantly surprised.   They have indoor and outdoor seating and is located in the very nice and tranquil 2nd Street in downtown (at least in comparison to 6th street).  The food here is really good.  I tried the caponatta for my antipasto and it was fresh and delicious.   I had a chance to speak with owner, a very nice and welcoming Italian gentleman who took the time to explain the dishes and make recommendations.  My entrée choice was the vegetable lasagna and it reminded me of the one my Calabrian Nonna used to make.  Nice wine list, I went with Nero d'abola from Sicily which was perfect pairing with my food.  Overall a great experience.",5.0 star rating

Amazing salad, great white pizza (the no. 28) but the real service was when it started to rain. They did whatever they could to put an umbrella over our head and comfortably get us dry.

"I came for happy hour a week or so ago and again for dinner a few nights later, gagging to go back and try the food because the inside is so so so beautiful. I LOVE the beautiful wooden back bar, the floor tile choices, the almost-too-many plants, the glass conservatory and the gigantic sofas. For happy hour curled up on the couch with a glass of red wine it is perfect! But I came back again for the food - and all was not quite well... good oysters but a pretty mediocre fillet mignon served uninspiringly - two rather random pots of sauce just plopped on the plate with a strangely small portion of fries. It wasn't bad per se - It just didn't come close to living up to the surroundings. And with a final bill that came to more than $100 a head I want my experience to be exceptional not blahhhh.

"Do you like being transported to another time where attention to detail was paramount? Then let's talk about Eberly for a moment. When you enter this beautiful establishment your smacked in the face with the amazing ambience. From the octagon tile that covers the entire floor, to the brass top bar in the restaurant, the brass lighting that creates an individual feel for tables in a wide open environment, to the clever seating. Turn to the right, and there is a big bright atrium type dining area giving the feeling of eating outside. This sits directly across from the open kitchen. In the back of the restaurant is the true hidden secret. Housed within the Cedar Tavern is the most amazing mahogany bar built in 1866 in New York City, and imported to Eberly when the Cedar Tavern in NY closed.All of that, and we haven't even discussed food yet. My wife and I started with a dozen oysters, 6 of which were raw and 6 were wood roasted oysters Angelina. While both were very good I was partial to the raw. They were served with the most delicious mignonette, and were perfectly briny. Then I took a leap and ordered something I never would. I decided on the Redfish withlump crab, buttered herb cracker crumble, and squash piquant. OH MY GOODNESS! This was easily one of the best dishes I have had in all of Austin. Where to begin? The skin was amazingly crispy with a flaky and moist flesh. Lump crab meat that was truly still in lump form. All sitting on a spicy squash piquant that set this whole dish off! Simply amazing. With all of the details in the interior they paid even closer attention to the food. The best part of Eberly is that whether you want upscale, or a little more casual with the tavern it has it all to offer. Cheers to the bartenders, server, and Chef! I will be back.",4.0 star rating
"I was in Austin and planning to eat dinner at a gastropub. Told a group of people about my plans, and they all exclaimed: ""NO!!!!!"" Austin is quickly vaulting to national prominence as a gourmand's destination, and Dorothy D. and Michelle F. warned me that I'd be passing up an opportunity. Intrigued by their fervor and passion, I began reconsidering. I changed my mind for good when one Mark H., a local resident, insisted that I absolutely had to go here, sit at the bar to watch the ""sausage"" (sushi) made. Like Dorothy D. and Michelle F., he was also appalled at the idea of wasting an Austin dinner with a burger and fries. (Thank God that I didn't tell him I ate a slice of pizza from 7-11 because I got in at 2 AM the previous night, and it was all that was available!!)Uchi it was. Austin resident and buddy Julie M. warned me of the swank factor and the pricetag, but as they say, ""When in Austin..."" Half of me kind of wanted the place to be bad so that I could do an EWWWWchi pun, like what I did with EWWWWmani Burger (Umani Burger, LAX location only, not the whole chain.) The food is pretty unbelievable, though. I went all-out and had the following: 18-piece sashimi platter, hamachi nabe (rice yellow tail thing), akami te (big-eyed tuna appetizer thing), 12 additional pieces of tuna and salmon, and finally some Japanese cheesecake. I sat next to two college-aged kids and this annoying dude in a baseball cap who kept making creepy comments and looked like disgraced former Lakers Basketball Operations President/manchild Jim Buss (pbs.twimg.com/profile_im…). Their reaction to each successive dish was WTF!!! (Hey, maybe it's your obsession with superficial body image metrics that's the problem, ever think of that?!)Except for the Japanese cheesecake, all of these were absolutely sublime. I've argued in this space that sushi does not probably have as much of an upside given that it's fundamentally just raw fish in the end. But uchi has a way of putting a truly unique stamp on it that I'm surprised other places don't try more. They put something in the soy sauce that gives it a slight tang. It feels like just a touch of wasabi and maybe garlic or green onion. I dunno! Each sashimi dish is also topped off with a seat of unique seasonings, like aioili (sp) on one of them. While I still thing excellent sushi is excellent sushi in the end, regardless of where you have it or what the price tag is, I do appreciate these little bells and whistles, plus superb aesthetic in the presentation. The non-sushi dish, hamachi nabe, was INSANE and the best part. I wish I had known it would be this good, because I would have ordered like 2-3 of them. (I didn't for reasons that I'll discuss below.) This is probably the best rice dish that I have ever had in my life.I ultimately have to dock a star as part of my ongoing effort to curb grade inflation here at MC3. #MerlinFIVEEEEEES (elongate the vowel, elevate the pitch) can't be growing on trees. Here are the two reasons why. First, the queueing theory (QT) game is not good. The stuff came out really slowly, and I'd say I spent 90 more minutes next to annoying Jim Buss guy than I had to. I didn't know to do this, but you should definitely just ask them to bring the stuff all out at once and not to stagger it. I think they do this so it feels like a typical multi-course fancy meal, but I wasn't here for that. I was here to GET IN, EAT, and GET OUT (GIEGO!) Your stomach also starts getting impatient and threatens to close up if you go on too long like this, but this is me with the #TEAMAZN metabolism so luckily that wasn't an issue. Second, I was underwhelmed by the dessert. Decor is nice and not over the top, unlike many fancypants sushi places (ugh to every time I see another fake cultural appropriating Buddha statue at a fushion restaurant). And unlike those places, people at Uchi dress in a way that doesn't make you seem like you walked into a Saks Fifth Avenue robo-mannequin display from 2036.",4.0 star rating
"Two thumbs down for this smug Austin eatery that has replaced courtesy with carelessness, at best. We ""waited at the bar"", as directed by the ""host"",  for over an hour. When we had enough and decided to leave, we were told ""they came to look for us"". It's ok to make a mistake, but not cool to lie. We asked to speak to a manager who seemed to think a coupon for a few margaritas was just compensation for rude behavior on the part of his staff. As far as we are concerned, ""The Countess"" is ""down for the count"". Avoid.",2.0 star rating
"On a recent Friday we tried to book a reservation for the next night at Eberly.  Unfortunately there were no reservations available that Saturday, so we decided to show up at 5 pm and see if we could get a seat at the bar without a reservation. Fortunately for us, this strategy worked and we were able to be seated right away at the the Cedar Tavern.The Cedar Tavern section of Eberly is gorgeous.  The focal point of the space is the Cedar Tavern bar which resided in New York City from 1866 to 2006.  The wood and the glass of the bar gleam, and the bartenders shine along with it presenting wonderfully friendly and competent service.We enjoyed everything that we ordered.  The duck fat fries with gravy and cheese curds were crisp and golden, the spongy cheese curds had just the right amount of salt, and these qualify for contention for a place on any list of best fries.  The brussels and cauliflower brought out the best of both veggies.  The Belly N' Butts was a pretty good pizza. The pizza makers take great pride in their from scratch dough and incredible pizza ingredients.  For two of us these three dishes more than filled us, and unfortunately we were not able to finish all of the fries.",4.0 star rating
"This place is unreal. It's like stepping into a fairytale. I feel sure that it will be featured in many a movie, photo shoot, magazine. Sitting at the bar, rose in hand, I chatted with patrons to my right who were approximately 60 and way hip to the scene. They ordered apps and shared tips and we had a lovely time chatting over the soulful jazz wafting through the speakers. My party arrived (I was early for the first time evar) and we took to a circular booth in the main dining room. Glancing at the menu, I was immediately in sticker shock (but then, I normally am.) We ordered a dish each and some oysters. The service was fine though the cocktails were pretty short. The food unfortunately was not memorable. Adequate, to be sure. But if I'm paying $45 for a steak, it feels like I should be blown away. The caveat here is that this is kind of where Austin is trending - above-average food with really high price tags to pay the rent. Add on the fact that it's a local cut or chicken and that apparently justifies the cost. I think many of us simply can't afford to pay for the bronze fixtures or the crystal chandeliers. Come here if you want to impress someone. Come here if you want to pay $95 for a pot of seafood stew. Come here for a bev at the historic bar. Come here if you just got paid. Come here if the experience of your surrounds is paramount.",3.0 star rating
"Me and my boyfriend were very excited to try Eberly! We were celebrating and were instantly thrilled when we walked in. Here is my quick synopsis: Atmosphere is beautiful and the food was great. Service lacks.We got sat at our table and had to wait 12 minutes before a waiter even acknowledged us - ended up saying a brief ""I'll be right over there shortly to give you my full attention!"" There was an amazing couple next to us finishing up their meal who entertained us (thank goodness) and told us that we need to hear the story of the back room bar. When the server finally came over, the couple let them know to tell us the story. In which, the server responded that right now we needed to start our food journey - understandable and we were excited!We started with the Honey Do and the Pina  Ponche. They were both amazing!! We also got the charcuterie board which was great as well. We then ordered the steak and fries, scallops, short-rib, mac and cheese side and cauliflower/brussels side. Everything was AMAZE-BALLS. My only complaint would be that the short-rib was a little over done. We decided to close the tab and grab one last drink in the bar in the back room to see the history. Our server never told us the story of the back bar and somehow seemed overly busy. This seemed surprising when our tab was over $220 for dinner. I expected a little more friendliness and check-ins. However, the server assistant was amazing and flipped tables quickly and always had our waters filled.When we got back to the back room bar there were a couple of open seats around the bar and probably about three tables in the open lounge that had guests. There were TWO bartenders behind the bar and not a single one acknowledged we sat down. We waited and admired the architecture, but finally had enough when they had finished the drinks of everyone else on the bar and then helped a guest that had just walked up still without even saying hi to us. Went home and cracked open a bottle of wine in comfy sweatpants, ha ha. Ultimately, if they want to stay around they will need to up their service side.",3.0 star rating
"Had my Sushi cherry popped at Uchi.  I wanted to pop my cherry at the best (or one of) sushi places first.  Then I went on to try Sushi at several places around Austin before I wanted to write a review, because I was not sure what to compare it to. After sushi hopping around Austin, I can tell you Uchi has it going on!  The Uni at Uchi was the best I have had thus far!  Uchi was the only place that served it properly and gave you the expected portion.  My favorite however was the Unagi.  I can now say I am an Unagi LOVER!!!We took my Son here for his birthday and Uchi did not disappoint.  Reservations are strongly recommended! Bonus....they offer valet parking.  Below is a list of all the Nigir I tried on this visit and can recommend to others with confidence:-Hamachi -Sake -Santa Barbara Uni -Akami -Ebi -Unagi -Hirame-Mirame-Hamachi-Sake Toro-Ikura We also tried a few rolls, all very good.  For Dessert the chef sent us over a special treat and we also ordered the Creme Caramel.  Delicious.",5.0 star rating

What a disappointment. Visited Austin for the first time and had La Condesa recommended to us for dinner. The service was sullen and the portions were tiny but expensive (no joke...$18 for what was essentially a chunk of roasted cauliflower). The food was pretty meh anyways. The only positive thing I have to say is that the space is beautiful. The guys at the host stand were friendly too.,2.0 star rating

"Came and met a few friends for cocktails in the back bar. From the outside this place looks pretty basic, the inside is where the magic happens. Great structure and the outdoor area is beautiful. The story on the bar is that it was bought from NY and stored until its beautiful debut in this space. It definitely doesn't have an Austin feel (less the friendly staff). The cocktails are fresh and flavorful. Will be back to try the food.",5.0 star rating
"The space was swanky and the crowd was beautiful but is this the hot new Austin restaurant we've all been waiting for? Nopeeeeeee.As huge as the place is, it was extremely loud so everyone just decided to get plastered since we couldn't have a conversation. They were out of a lot of menu items by 9pm but we still managed to order quite a feast. The standouts for the night were the crab and cornbread, the Eberly salad, and the steak and frites...but cmon, it's just steak and frites. I was not impressed with the redfish, it was overwhelmed by tomato and pineapple. I was not impressed with the woodgrilled oysters, there was potential but they were served lukewarm. And I never thought I'd say this but I didn't even like their butter. WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.Service was a mess from the host to the timing but they were generous enough to treat us to complimentary dessert. The PB and raspberry was great with such creamy peanut butter flavors and the chocolate budino was tasty but extremely rich. I'm mature enough to look past the small things for a newly opened restaurant but as I walked down South Lamar last night passing some of the best restaurants in the city, I found myself wishing we had gone there instead.",2.0 star rating
"My sister gave me a gift card to Eberly for Christmas that has really been burning a hole in my wallet since then. Every time I'd driven past the place it looked packed, and it's been popping up all over ""best of Austin"" lists everywhere. My friend and I were able to have dinner out on the patio in 75 degree weather, doesn't really get much better!I was excited to finally get to sit down at this place. I made reservations for a early-ish time on a Tuesday - you're basically forced to, as Eberly's skyrocketed in popularity and they have pretty limited seating. We started with a couple of cocktails that the server said they had just rolled out pretty recently. I had one that was kinda like a rye old fashioned but a little sweeter and carbonated.We kinda played around with the menu, because we weren't particularly starving and they had a lot of starters that looked like they would've made good main entrees. My friend ordered two starters for her meal - the brussels & cauliflower as well as the farm vegetables (turned out to be beets, broccoli, potatoes, & tomatoes). I had my eye on the Crab & Cornbread with caramelized onions and jalapeno cornbread, but I ultimately went for the  Braised Shortribs. I am SO glad I did. They looked and tasted so good that my ""loosely vegan"" friend had to have a bite. Definitely worth a trip down to Eberly sometime soon if you can make it. Great service, spectacular attention to detail with their food (check out the presentation of those veggies in that pic), and a really cool woodsy/modern atmosphere dotted with plants and books everywhere. The only downside here might be how crowded the place can be and the fact that you can really only valet your car. I will definitely return when it's a bit warmer and the upstairs rooftop bar is open! I can only imagine the views of downtown from up there.",4.0 star rating
"The food was fabulous! Getting in as a newbie was tricky because the place is so popular. Uchi opens the doors at 4:30 to take names for seating and reservations but doesn't seat people until 5:00pm. Unknowingly, we arrived at 5:00pm on the dot. No one was seated but we were told it was a 15 minute wait. It was a little confusing. By the time we were seated 15 minutes later, people were eating. Plenty of staff and a quick turnaround time for food. First time there our waiter forgot part of our order and gave us a $25. Credit for next time. Next time, they somehow ran out of rice and it was a 20 minute wait for anything that requires rice. All that being said, we would definitely go again. It's worth the wait!",4.0 star rating
"This place was an absolute treat. Everything from the decor, the food, the sake and the service were 5/5. We had reservations for 9:00 and they promptly seated us.

"Okay, I don't give THAT many reviews but I felt I should in this case.. I'll start out with the food first.. We had mostly appetizers and one entree and everything was excellent. The bread was great with a touch of salt and something else I couldn't nail down, and the pasta with brown butter was great too.. I was told the pot pie was good and it was.. I generally don't rate places unless its really great or really bad, more than that and I may be too much like a dumb millennial that has too much time on their hands. Here is my issue with the place: The bathroom situation.. My GF excused herself and headed to the restroom, and when she came back she told me how confused she was and that I was not going to like it..The dumb bathrooms are unisex or gender neutral or whatever dumb PC label you want to put on it. She went in to the restrooms and a guy was coming out which made her back up and look at the door. The guy coming out told her they were ""gender neutral"" so she went in and used the facilities but was a little put off by the experience. After our dinner she needed to go again (she ""goes"" quite often) so I went with her to see for myself and the situation became more comical. I stayed in the sink area and she was about to go into a stall and another woman came in and saw me, she promptly backed out (like my GF did earlier) and came back in. I explained the situation and she headed towards a stall, which she quickly backed out of because of the smell, I loudly exclaimed: ""Welcome to the men's room, its nasty isn't it"" Another woman who was washing her hands told me this is how they do it in Europe, to which I replied ""No they don't, I've been there many times and have never seen a similar bathroom"".  I should have told her this is not Europe, but regardless the bathrooms are not that way in Europe. I'm no stuffy character, I have no problem dropping a deuce while someone who I am dating or is married to is nearby, but when you go out to eat its supposed to be more special. You shouldn't have to smell or hear a stranger take a dump. All men reading this know what goes on in a men's room, it's nasty and something you shouldn't have to deal with when you go to dinner. Another by-product of this type of restroom is what happens at the W Hotel bar downtown, people have sex in the bathrooms quite frequently after they have liquored up a bit and get frisky.. There you go, my 2 cents.. Maybe 20 cents..",3.0 star rating

"My only issue was at dinner there was a couple seated next to us that were dressed, in my opinion way too casual.  They had on t-shirts, shorts and flip flops.  If I am paying over $100 for a meal I expect the dress to be a little stepped up from the normal Austin casual vibe.  If the couple were sitting in the bar area than that would have been okay.This was our first time at Eberly and we were pleasantly surprised by the good tasting meal.  The charcuterie board was amazing and the liver pate was whipped and buttery.  Local cheeses from Antonelli's shop were a perfect pick.  The special of the evening was  a red fish schnitzel and the dish did not disappoint.  The craft cocktails were tasty along with the grasshopper torte for dessert.The waiter new everything about the menu and drinks and did perfect with the suggestions.We will definitely come back again for date night!",4.0 star rating
Uchi was one of the best sushi places. First heard  about on a trip to Seattle this spring. If you can get a spot at the bar it's super fun and interactive: I would highly recommend this for an upscale sushi meal. Honestly it wasn't as pricey as I thought it would be.

"Came here as a walk in for the sake social and it was worth every minute of the wait. Their sake social/happy hour is so worth it. We pretty much ordered one of every dish, except for the veggies. Zero sen was so good we had to order 2 of them! While the wait was long (1.5 hours to be exact and we came right when they opened at 5pm), the wait staff came by several times with complimentary little appetizers. Our waitress even offered to refrigerate our bottle of water to keep it cool for later! We came here as a pre-meal before our actual dinner so didn't expect to eat anything heavy. However, when the chef asked if we wanted the foie gras nigiri... were we expected to say no?! If I'm ever in Austin again, I would definitely go back.

"We stopped by La Condesa for Happy Hour on Friday.  This place was very good.  Unique, contemporary Mexican cuisine.  Happy Hour runs from 5-7pm on weekdays.  During this time, the restaurant offers half-priced drinks and a special food menu offering about a dozen small plate items for anywhere from $2-6.  A great deal for sure.The restaurant is named after the fashionable and youthful Condesa neighborhood of Mexico City.  Atmosphere is open, inviting, and trendy.  Very cool architecture and design.  Colorful mural artwork, light, billowy curtains, interesting and creative light fixtures, and decorative candle-lit walls made with broken cinder blocks.  I can see why this place is popular.Our group showed up at the right time (~5pm) because by the time we left, it was standing room only.  People at the bar were eyeing our table like vultures.  They swooped in as soon as the first person from our group stood up to leave.We stopped by for drinks and snacks before dinner and a night out, so I only a tried a few things off their menu:Salsas and Guacamole - four seasonal salsas and traditional guacElotes - Mexican-style street corn, Cotija cheese, chili powderHuitlacoche Sope - wild mushrooms, huitlacoche, yellow corn, farmer's cheese, queso chihuahua, epazote, truffle oilThe Salsas and Guac were very good.  Salsas ranged from the sweet and sour to spicy and smoky.  We ordered the traditional guac, which was smooth and flavorful.  Not chunky.  La Condesa also offers a few other guacs including chipotle + almond, pomegrante + queso fresco, and crab + apple.I really enjoyed the Elotes.  It's a whole corn on the cob dipped in grated Cotija cheese and sprinkled with red chili powder.  The combination of powdered chili and crumbly cheese made for a savory and well-seasoned corn on the cob.  A small slice of lime was also served with the dish for additional flavor.The Huitlacoche Sope was beautifully presented.  It was pretty intense for a small sope.  The many ingredients produced a wide range of flavors from the aromatic mushrooms to the pungent epazote herb.  The cheeses were melted.  This dish was also a bit salty.  Definitely one for the adventurous eaters.Great, personable service.  Friendly bartenders and cute waitresses.  The male servers wore guayaberas.  One of the managers served our table and she did an excellent job.",4.0 star rating
"The experience that I had at La Condesa is one that I will not soon forget!  We were in Austin for a bachelorette party and had arranged for a private dinner at La Condesa.  The general dining area is filled with high energy, but we were taken to a private dining space on the lower level of the restaurant.  This space felt like our own private cavern!  We were so excited to have such a great hide away for our special dinner.  We could easily hear each other and we were eager to begin our family style dinner!While dining, we enjoyed the following: Appetizers: Margarita la Condesa - Features a lime margarita with pineapple juice. YUM!Chips and Salsa - Too Spicey for me, but the rest of the group enjoyed it!Guacamole - AWESOME! So fresh!Ensalada de la casa - Simple house salad with a homemade dressingHongos y Huitlacoche Huaraches - If you are a mushroom lover this appetizer is for you!  Mushrooms, corn, and farmer's cheese.  Sweet, salty, and the meatiness of the mushrooms had me going for seconds!Tostadas de Atun - Sashimi tuna with pickles, shallots, and chipotle mayo - very refreshing!Main Dishes: We enjoyed the braised short rib, grilled head-on shrimp (the head is the best part!), and citrus rubbed roasted chicken.  Each dish was well prepared, incredibly flavorful, and we couldn't stop enjoying!  For side dishes we had the grilled green beans, the house black beans & rice, and Mexican street corn (THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE THING! I had never had it before and I can't stop thinking about it!).As if we hadn't eaten enough, they brought out dessert.  SO MUCH FOOD!  For dessert we had the spiced, flourless chocolate cake with brown sugar-banana ice cream. Unfortunately, the spice in the cake would over power my throat, but I can't handle spice at all.  Others were able to enjoy it and I did like the ice cream.  I wish I could have had a bowl of just that!Final thoughts: La Condesa made a special night extra special for my bride to be.  The atmosphere, service, and food were all exceptional.  I would highly recommend this to any one looking for a great dining experience!",5.0 star rating
"Ate here with a big group (12 people) for a Bachelorette Party and Eberly accomidated us wonderfully. We sat at a long high top near the bar. The decor is awesome - very intimate yet fun vibe. The wait staff was super friendly and patient with our large group. The bathrooms were very cool and unique - unisex!The food was so delicious too! From the tuna tartar and burrata as apps - both were very fresh and good sizes. The carrots were a bit smoky, which I liked. For a meal, I got the Halibut which was amazing and melted in my mouth. It was a great size too. For sides we got shells & cheese (amazing), Brussels & cauliflower (amazing) and farm vegetables (amazing). Really, you cant go wrong it seems with anything you get.

Meat literally falling off the bones. A little on the salty side though. And $12 for 3 little pieces of lump crab on crackers? So good, but so...expensive.

"I had high hopes since sushi is by far my favorite food to eat. Maybe this is a confirmation of how good the quality of sushi in the SF Bay area is. 1. The size of the nigiri was bit of a joke. I've seen some small sushi pieces but this is by far the smallest piece of nigiri i've ever seen. I would pay a few dollars more for a real nigiri size. I thought everything was bigger in Texas? 2. Fish quality was good. They had some rare white fish that is pretty difficult to find in US sushi restaurants. 3. The selection of food was a bit mediocre. We looked through the menu many times and didn't really find anything enticing to eat other than sushi. 4. The order of nigiri was out of order. Usually you want to serve in order of lighter fish and end it with a heavier fish like tuna, bonito, etc. I don't expect this with a low to mid end restaurant but since this is a $$$$ rated place, I would expect them to consider this. 5. Japanese food has to have a rice or noodle dish. That is traditionally how you end the meal in Japan. Only option was a $14 ochazuke. (more fish options, soups, or noodle dish like udon would be good)6. Ginger seemed to be marinated differently and did not like it. Ginger is supposed to be a palate cleanser for the next nigiri. It had this bit of a weird sweetness that lingered in mouth which threw off the nigiri. The traditional acidic fresh ginger will suffice.7. Onigiri - palm sized rice ball sometimes with a filling inside. Palm size is the key. We ended up getting a tiny marble size rice balls. Despite the size the taste was good. 8. Higawari Sakana - fish of the day. It was tasty but no where in the menu or the waitress mentioned it was tempura. I thought from the description it was going to be carpaccio/tataki style.9. Rolls - don't get it. We got 2 and they looked exactly the same. Did not like the sesame chili sauce that came with it. High point was foie gras nigiri was good and was actually a decent size. (why can't they make all their nigiri that size?)Dessert was also really good. Props to the pastry chef with foie gras ice cream.When I visit Texas, I'll stick to Tex Mex and BBQ. Sushi experience was disappointing to say the least.",2.0 star rating

Once happy hour ended, we decided to keep ordering and decided on the fish tacos, which were also excellent.Service was speedy (she made sure to get our order in before happy hour ended!) and great. The awesome decor isn't hard on the eyes either. I wish I could decorate my own place half as cool as it looks in there!",5.0 star rating
"Went to La Condesa for an early dinner on Sunday and had an absolutely wonderful experience. Let me start by saying that I love 2nd Street here in Austin and many of my favorite restaurants reside on the few blocks West of Congress. That being said I have been to La Condesa a handful of times up to this point and have always been thoroughly impressed with their drinks, service, ambiance, and above all their food. Let me start with our server, Monique. She was knowledgeable of every dish, and even went above and beyond when I asked her a nerdy food question. Her recommendations were on point left and right. From stuffed pequillo pepper chile rellenos to smoked brisket pastrami taquitos, she never steered us wrong. She was also very attentive, helpful, and on top of her game. Her service alone deserved a 5 star review.I think it goes without saying that I highly recommend dinner here, but this particular meal was exquisite from top to bottom and more than enough food for 4 of us. Here's the list of what we had, all of which I would say are worth the order: - Guacmole sampler - who says no to guac (especially when they put pineapple or lump crab in it)- Trucha ceviche - a nice appetizer for 4 of us, but not a ton of food, won't fill you up but the salmon belly was wonderful and the flavor of the dish as a whole was awesome. - Veracruzana - I don't love octopus, just the idea grosses me out, but this dish was probably my favorite of the night. The flavor combination and texture discrepancy between the saffron aoli, octopus, and the tostada were flawless. - Chile Relleno - Quinoa stuffed peppers... what else do you want? - Carne Torcida - Smoked brisket pastrami, I literally could have eaten 100 of them. I also had two of their house margaritas and the absolute BEST brussel sprouts in Austin. I don't say that lightly and if you've read down this far please please please do yourself a favor and order yourself these brussel sprouts. I not only ordered one to share, but one to go and ate them the moment I got home. All in all it was another great La Condesa experience, and this time around it was so good that I needed to tell the world. 5 stars.",5.0 star rating
"When in for Happy Hour which was half priced drinks at bar. Decor and ambiance are nice, how ever bartenders had little personality. When entering the establishment the hostess did not even look at us and the bartenders did not give a welcoming greeting when my friend and I sat down at the bar. Margarita was just your average run on the mill margarita. Most likely won't be retuning.",3.0 star rating

"Such a cute place! The decor is amazing and you definitely feel like you are in a magazine when you are inside. There is complimentary valet, which is great because parking on S Lamar is not fun. Service was great--our waters were never empty and everything was quick. The food was good not great. I got the chicken & waffles. The chicken was amazing and juicy but the waffles were pretty bland and needed lots of syrup to make them tastier. I will probably be back but the food didn't blow my mind.",4.0 star rating

"Overrated was the first word that came to mind after my first dining experience there. After all the Yelp hyped reviews I was disappointed that the sushi was prepared in assembly line style. I guess I'm used to watching the chef prepare my order from start to finish, however observed my order handled by other chefs. We ordered both from happy hour & dinner menu. The price & portion was as expected in a sushi place. The menu was limited, disappointed our chef didn't entertain off menu items. The flavors were nothing to be desired, equivalent to prepared meal ready eats at HEB or Whole Foods.3 stars for overall food, service & dining experience - just another sushi place. Total experience for two people + tip was $150.1 star for the bartender steering me towards the $19/glass wine. I unwittingly had two glasses. It was happy hours & I wrongly assumed the place had house white (typically most bartenders understood when one asks for house white, it means nothing too fancy). Be sure to check prices if you think alcohol should cost less than food.",3.0 star rating
"Easily my favorite restaurant in the world. I haven't been everywhere, mind you. There are some Michelin ranked ones I'm dying to try for sure, but Uchi is most definitely up there alongside them.Splurge and get the Omikase ($$$$). It's the most unique and delicious sushi experience you'll have. Chef Cole does not go traditional here and it's worth your time and money to have his creative genius delight your taste buds and astound you with dishes you might never consider ordering on your own. Everything here it top notch, sourced from the best markets on Earth.If you don't do the Omikase, Happy Hour is a great, more affordable, and less packed option.",5.0 star rating
"Before arriving in Austin, I read multiple blogs & reviews about local restaurants. La Condesa is named in so many blogger's reviews as a top choice. Very curious, I had to try it myself, so I came for brunch. Tried multiple dishes. Guacamole tasting was delicious, the jumbo lump crab meat, apple & coconut vinegar one was the best. The Veracruzana was amazing, I wanted to lick the dish, I could not get enough of it. Even the hardest critic my extremely picky daughter raved about the traditional guacamole & had 2 orders of the Flautas de Pollo, best she ever had. The signature cocktail, Margarita La Condesa was light, with a fresh fruit taste, the best I've had in Austin so far. The service was great & the staff was very aware of food allergies. So far the family favorite spot in Austin! Nothing was disappointing well worth the 30 minute wait.",5.0 star rating
My sister and I go there today for lunch after a morning of bad circumstances. My sister ordered a chicken sandwich. After eating half of a half she realized the meat looked odd and thought maybe they accidentally put ham instead.  Turned out it was raw chicken! We notified the server who got the manager. They apologized and offered another bring another meal. She declined and said she had lost her appetite. We asked the waiter to check us out and to my shock the only thing they did was remove the meal my sister didn't eat! Seriously? I was shocked. I would have expected a high end facility to have better customer service then that!  I told the manager as we were leaving that I was shocked and all he did was so he was sorry....even comping a drink or a part of the bill would have been appreciatedIronically when we were in the apt elevator talking about it a man chimed in his last experiences were poor and he wasn't going back.  I'll give 1 star as the specialty drinks are very tasty. So disappointed. And more poor sister hasn't felt good rest of day and has to drive back to San Antonio feeling nauseous.,1.0 star rating
"I was somewhat disappointed with this place . The food was fantastic , amazing taste , portions were very small and prices were pretty high , but that's not the real problem. The problem we experienced was with the service, we had a party of 6 and our server (VV)  was to say the least inattentive , my friend ordered a salad that never arrived and we had to remind the server , she hadn't put in the order and we cancelled it . The bill was for the whole dinner and she had us separate it ourselves , she didn't really stop by our table more than three times and we had to continuously ask other servers to help us , and her attitude was just bad, plain and simple . Eventually she saw us struggle with diving the bill and said she would finally take care of it herself . She had asked us to write down what amount we wanted charged on each card but did not even provide a pen or paper ? And after the fact my friend realized the server charged his card twice , once for the correct amount and the second time she charged him 55 dlls , after he called super mad (as anyone would be) somebody explained to him that the server had made a mistake and fixed it so he'd get his money refunded but she should have explained this to him on the spot ! Not an hour later after he freaked out when he checked his bank account ! Basically we wanted to eat , pay and leave but somehow we ended up doing her job for her , it was ridiculous and the whole experience turned sour . The place itself was very nice , loved the food and the patio but left extremely disappointed with the service .",2.0 star rating
"Ahh Uchi, an Austin favourite, and deservedly so.  Always great, and despite having to wait two hours for a table, and I hate waiting, it was a very pleasurable experience.  We were able to order some fantastic Edamame and Saki whilst waiting in their relaxing little front yard and were treated to a very tasty meal with service from Mandy that was exceptional.We went for one of the tasting menus, with six courses including a dessert. As it happens a couple of the courses were ones we were looking at ordering anyway, so it worked out even better! What I think I like most however, is that compared to how much you can spend for mediocre sushi, the cost here, whilst not cheap, is certainly good value.",5.0 star rating

"Wow, this play is nice for their happy hour.Went with two other people and between us all we went through 4 rolls, two appetizers and two of us had drinks other than water. After all of that the bill was only about 50 bucks and we all left full.  Let me repeat that, we all left full. That is a key point to make with sushi. In the past it seemed that no matter how much I ate I wouldn't get full but we all managed to do it for 50 bucks here. I will be returning at some point.Try it out.",4.0 star rating
"Their lunch is great.  Fast and fresh.  I usually get the shrimp tempura bento box or sushi bento.  It's well priced for lunch and I've never been disappointed.The reverse happy hour is hella good. The cuts of sushi and the little grilled options are all really good.  The lychee martinis go down a little too smooth and black peper infused bloody sake is also yummy.It's great for lunch, dinner, happy hour, reverse happy hour.  It's open late and it's dependable!",4.0 star rating
"SAKE BOMB! SAKE BOMB! SAKE BOMB! SAKE BOMB!That is usually the chant you hear at any sushi restaurant coming from our table. I will admit, I think my group of friends and I love going to east sushi b/c of Sake bombs. They go together like beer and hotdogs at the ball game lol Ok, so back on to matter at hand. We went to BarChi to celebrate my friends birthday. I had never been here prior, so this was a first time for me. The restaurant is very nice, love the atmosphere. Very swanky, hip vibe. Definitely would be a GREAT date night place, or HH spot.Sitting down, first things first, had to order some hot sake and kirin. I will say, this place would have gotten a 5 if not for this next part. To my surprise, no larger portions of sake, and no big beers :(  That is the only thing I wish would change, so instead of one big beer, we had to order 2 at a time. Only gripe.The food was AMAZINGLY good. For apps we had the Calamari, chicken satay, and tomato bacon wraps. Honestly the calamari was the best I have had to date, perfectly fried. It was light and crunchy, not at all chewy. Loved it. Rolls we gobbled down in record speeds:  Volcano, Shaggy Dog, 2002, Chicken Crunch, Scorpion, and Philadelphia.We had 2-3 of a few of them, and each was as good as the last. We had someone with us who wasn't a huge sushi fan and even they were asking for the last pieces lol That's how good it was.For being where it is located and the quality of food, I really would think this place would be double its cost. The rolls are very well priced. might say cheap even. If you come for reverse happy hour, yes I said REVERSE happy hour,it starts at 10, you get alot of rolls super cheap.I will be coming back here more often that is certain, I am not sure why this place is only rater 3 1/2, definitely is alot better then that. Get my big beers and sake kettles and you will win my heart over BarChi :)",4.0 star rating
"The sushi here was great. The food was excellently prepared, and the quality of fish was above par. You can actually taste the flavor of the fish as opposed to just tasting like ice. I ordered the sashimi flight. To be honest I was expecting 18 completely individual pieces of sashimi, but instead got 3 pieces of 6 varieties of sashimi. It was still delicious. However the squid was over cooked and rubbery. Other than that, all of the pieces were fresh, clean, and thickly cut. You're definitely getting your money's worth. We went in a Sunday when they have drink and sushi specials all day. I recommend this, because you can order twice as much for the same cost. My girlfriend really liked their strawberry and orange martini, and they have decent selection of Japanese imported beer. The Asahi Black was exceptionally good. The service was pretty fast, and by that I mean the kitchen and bar produced quickly. However I feel like our waiter could have been a bit more interactive. She wasn't very hospitable. Her first impression was setting water down, saying hi, and then disappearing. I also would have really appreciated her telling me what pieces of fish were in my flight too. If I didn't have a culinary background I imagine it would have been impossible to determine outside of the obvious albacore tuna and salmon. However, it was our first time visiting and it wasn't enough to keep us from going back. If you're in the area it's worth checking out.",4.0 star rating
"So utterly overrated. The sushi subpar and the service will put you in the worst kind of mood. Service: the 4 of us got our table at 8, ordered 2 rounds of drinks (wine/beer) and a total of 7 rolls, and that took 3 hours. It would've taken longer if we didn't ask for the bill right when we got our rolls, and paid. It took 45 minutes to get our first drink order, 1.5 hours to get our terrible sushi AFTER we ordered. Our waitress came out a total of 3 times, to bring our drink orders and the check. Someone else brought the rolls. Food: I don't know what everyone else is eating f our 7 rolls were pretty terrible. They were dry, flavorless, and some were even gross. They takes like HEB sushi. We got the spicy tuna, spicy shrimp, California, rock n roll, spider, and 2 more I can't remember. While their rolls weren't 'excessively expensive' ($7-10bucks each) there are better places, nicer people, and more delicious food to be had without having to track down your waitress, wait forever, and eat subpar sushi.",1.0 star rating
"I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because the service was slower than my liking. My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday around 3pm to check out their happy hour menu. We had just missed the lunch crowd and there weren't many tables sat. Although we weren't in a hurry, there were moments of empty drinks and waiting on our server to come by so we could order more food. The happy hour menu was sufficient and not lacking in options. I feel there was a fair amount to choose from in each category. I had a couple of bloody sake Mary's, my fav! We had a few appetizers, calamari and egg rolls were just right! The sushi rolls were great, too. We will definitely be back and I'd like to try some items off of the regular menu next time!",4.0 star rating
"We went in on a Sunday evening, no wait and the restaurant was about halfway full. We waited over 30 minutes for our sushi and the server was curt and did not pay us any mind as he passed our table.

"Either people are being stingy with their star-giving or I have no shame...this place is 5-stars in my book!!!  Barchi must be a hidden secret, because up until recently, I've never heard of it.  Now that my friends have introduced me here, this has been my go-to place for some awesome reverse happy hour DT.  Let's start with the minimal cons: parking is a b****, but so is everywhere else in DT Austin.  There's like a $4 garage a couple streets down, which is good.  The wait can also be crazy, but I always get there as soon as reverse HH starts to get a good spot.....if not, I'd say you're SOL cause this place gets crowded towards midnight.PROS!  Inside, the place looks modern and chic--it definitely encompasses the Austin-DT-nightlife feeling.  As soon as you walk in, you're in the bar area with a couple of tables and the DJ booth playing house/dubstep music.  What a great entrance!  In the back, there's the large dining area where most of everyone is seated.  There's also additional seating outside for when the weather is good.  Besides the decor, you can't beat the HH menu.  FOOD:  There's so much to choose from on their HH menu...from dumplings to skewers to sushi rolls to calamari.  I've had their calamari (delicious sauce), scallop and bacon skewers (OMG....SO GOOD), spicy salmon roll, austin roll (a MUST-GET...salmon, tuna, escolar, and avocado), and shrimp crunch roll.  Everything's super cheap!!!  Price is an average of $3-4 bucaroos.DRANKS:  Goodness....let's start with their $1.50 sake bombs.  WHAT.....let me rewrite that.  $1.50 SAKE BOMBS.  I also get their Lychee martini, which is also delicious (and strong, might I add).SERVICE:  One word: AWESOME!  Even though the place gets crazy, the service here is always on point.  I've been here a handful of times and never had a bad experience.  Staff is friendly, always smiling, and offers true advice as to what to order (versus the whole, oh everything is good here).All in all, Barchi is a great place to hit up before a great night downtown with the buddies.  From their wide (and CHEAP) selection of food choices for the sushi- and non-sushi lover, drinks that are strong, and the DJ pumping awesome music--this is the place to be for late night HH!",5.0 star rating

"Yeah, not so much. I suppose this is an average of the food being 3 (or 2.5) and the service being more like 1.5. Perhaps it was because we sat in the bar area. Maybe if we sat in the main dining room it would've been entirely different - so let's say this review is for eating in the bar.Bartender seemed pretty surly, just reeked of attitude. Hostesses were a little curt, considering only 1 bar table was taken and no one was seated outside when we arrived. We waited so long for our waitress I thought we didn't have one, and that we were supposed to give food orders to surly McBartender. I was assured we had one (curtly), but most of the time, she was largely missing, particularly the latter half of our meal & at check time. She was mediocre at best.The tempura soy in broth was somewhat tasty. As were the scallops with bacon & tomatoes with bacon, as most things wrapped in bacon usually are. However we didn't actually order the scallops, which were brought by mistake & not removed from the bill. The only real compliment I can give BarChi is they could give lessons on bacon-wrapped scallops, because most places don't cook the bacon enough in order to wrap but not overcook the scallop. Their bacon was crazy good, done perfectly. Ceviche tostadas were just okay, messy to eat. The shrimp tempura roll was eh, and the geisha roll was pretty good although generally I'm not a fan of rolls with cream cheese. I admit I didn't try enough actual sushi to make a solid judgment on their quality of fish. You can only tell so much when you order rolls not sushi. I liked the pineapple-infused sake surprisingly (supposedly done in house) because it was slightly but not stupidly sweet.I might've had a better experience in the main dining room, just a hunch. Definitely didn't get the greatest vibe from the clientele... everyone seemed like they were very much there to mack on each other - strangely meat-markety for a sushi place. If you love that, you will love it there. Personally, not my bag. Maybe I need a do-over to order better items and enjoy the main room...kinda hard to tell. But sitting in the bar I more or less felt like they considered us complete a$$holes.",2.0 star rating

"Recently went to Barchi for Sunday all day Happy Hour with our close friends. Atmosphere was great, however we were a bit bothered by some odd patrons. Our waitress was very courteous and polite, however probably the influx of people all at once, caused our food to arrive slowly. We only ordered whatever was on the Happy Hour menu, which was pretty basic, but had some fun items. Although chicken sushi does sound interesting, I recommend not ordering it. Lychee martinis and ceviche tostadas were our favorites!",3.0 star rating
"I am never coming here again.  The last two times I've been here, their service has been absolutely horrible!  It was to the point where I actually complained about it to the hostess up front.  It seems like they have a tendency to hire waitstaff with no serving experience whatsoever and although they have a bunch of people on the floor, they all seem to be running around the restaurant doing absolutely nothing.  Like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off.NEVER AGAIN BARCHI!Oh yeah, I also left my credit card there and when I called the restaurant the next day to inquire about it they said a credit card was never left.  Coincidentally, I had someone try to charge 4K on it a couple of hours later....",1.0 star rating
"I sort of groaned when I walked through the door Friday night. Oh great, ANOTHER super trendy looking sushi bar. Fortunately they have great tasting sushi to back that up!We were trying to make a happy hour with Keri B and Kimberly K, but were just a little late to partake in the happy hour. And by the time we arrived there were moving on down the street any way. We'll make it next time, ladies!While we understand that the happy hour is a great bargain, the flight of Sashimi was an excellent value too. There were 18 generously sliced pieces of 6 different types of fish all served on a bed of ice. This was some of the freshest sashimi I have ever eaten. Even the tuna was spot on! i hate getting old tuna. This really made my evening. Pic is included.Daniel J, my wife and I made quick work of the sashimi then went on to devour our chosen rolls. My wife ate the Kill Bill because she ""just saw the movie last week."" I had a spectacular volcano roll. Very happy with how that turned out. Crawfish and gooey spicy mayo. It ropes me in every time. BarChi knows how to make this one! Daniel had a spicy cajun oyster roll. I tried a piece and it was delish as well. BarChi has some creative rolls, but they don't overdo it like that roll-centric sushi restaurant in town. These rolls were better than anything over there!Sake bloody marys were also downed. I had two. They were good. They were spicy. Fun to have once, but I will likely get my normal choice of cold sake next time. And yes there will be a next time. This place isn't going on my ""Sad Sushi List.""One word of warning: We used the valet at the corner. Ever seen the Seinfeld episode with the valet leaving body odor in his car? Beyond Body Odor, or BBO? That happened to us. My God, that boy was stinky. On top of that it began to rain and we had to have the windows up on the way home!

"Pros: - Great happy hour. Very well priced sushi and drinks- Bartender named Paul is awesomeCons:- Expensive for the quality when not on happy hour prices- Terrible, terrible, terrible club music with laser lights in bar area at night time- Management were unwilling to make a simple substitution on a $25 Sushi combo platter. I was looking to substitute one of the items because I was allergic. We asked to substitute that item for a lesser priced item on the menu, and we were rudely told no. Worth noting that the place was completely empty, so the sushi chefs had plenty of time on their hands to make an easy substitution.

"This is gonna sound crazy, but one night my wife and I were leaving a Bob Schneider concert on 2nd street. We were eating about 9pm. This place was packed! But we got a 2top outside. My wife LOVES sushi. Me, not so much. It is extremely hard for me to find a sushi place because I crave the polar opposite. A burger. Most of the time, anyway.  I cannot tell you how good the sushi is here. I can tell you here, I had a fantastic meal and I am NOT your average green-eating light dinner eater. Or used to not be anyways... The Angus Burger here was surprisingly good. Not like the Mexican-restaurant-burgers that lack black pepper and a little seasoning.  This was a smoked burger, think Casino El Camino burger, except smaller, more expensive and at a sushi restaurant. So this review is dedicated to all my burger-loving, hemmorhoids-encroaching, carnivorous pals that really try to enjoy the places your companions enjoy but really just want a burger.And thank you to whoever added the burger to a sushi infested menu.

"There are dozens of amazing places to choose from for food in downtown Austin. As we walked by, the server Marco was outside telling us to come in, and I'm so glad he did. The decor was super nice, and casual. From a giant wine bottles along one side, to the wine placed as a nice backdrop behind the bar, it boasted a certain charm that the Italian restaurants have. We were then greeted by the owner Bernardo, and sat us at the bar. He was always there to greet customers at the door and assist his employees with anything. You could tell this was a guy people liked. Very fun and lighthearted feel which was different from the other places on the street.We started off with wine (obviously!) and bruschetta. The Prosecco was delicious, and I was hesitant since it came from the tap, but I was wrong. We started with bruschetta, amazing. Next, Bernardo recommended the meatballs and then the risotto balls (I forgot the name) I would recommend any of these appetizers.For my entree, my friend and I shared the Vegetarian Aracini.  The fried exterior held in  amazing gooey cheese with zucchini, and spinach.Oh- also we tasted the best cannolis to end our evening. .   The food was great, the atmosphere and staff were excellent, and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend this place for any date night, a group of friends out on the town or even if you're going alone. You won't regret it!!!",5.0 star rating

"4 stars because the vibe and ambiance was great and I do plan on returning. I went in because I had a craving for lasagna. Upon the recommendation of Marco's I ordered a small plate of the Polpette to begin. It came with about 6-7 small meatballs which I was envisioning differently. These were small with not enough sauce, and the cheese sprinkled on top had an awkward feel to shredded Kraft cheese. I didn't devour them like I normally do, thinking I was saving room for the vegetable lasagna I ordered as my main course. The lasagna came out and *sigh* it was underwhelming. Not in size, but in appearance. I don't know how to explain it but again, I envisioned a plate smothered in sauce with a thick coat of melted cheese on top. This was not that. The portion was sizable but the appearance was just meh. As I was eating it, chewing each bite 20 times to absorb all the flavor, I wondered why the pasta was so soft/undercooked. It almost melted into the rest of the ingredients and not in an ""explosion in my mouth"" sort of way. I ended up taking a few bites, enough to be polite, and then boxing up the rest. I think I'll have to get super stoned before eating the leftovers. But again, I'm going to give this place a few more tries, taste a few more things on the menu, and enjoy a few more of their delicious draft wine/bubbles before X'ing it out of my life.",4.0 star rating

"Excellent food!  Excellent Wine . . . we had the ""on tap"" wine and it was excellent!  We got turned away from the BBQ place across the street because of our 8 year old and were welcomed with open arms here.  The food was amazing, the service even better.  The place is small but very inviting.  We had the carpaccio, and a special dish of saffron rice stuffed with meat sauce with peas that was fried -- omg . . . too good to describe.  They have some specialty dishes as well that we tried that were amazing.  Will be back.  Really a gem.",5.0 star rating

"Very nice place with some dishes that will allow your creative desires forNew yet fresh and tasty dishes be sampled shared and devoured. The soups are amazing, the butternut squash and Lobster bisque was amazing, the shrimp pizolli (sp) could compete with my neighbors homeMade version both are delicious. The oysters were so fresh that reallyDidn't need any sauce, clean and delicious. The server was attentive yet allowed us privacy. This is a place that you must try at least once as they will entice you to come back based on how wonderful the food is and the staff is very supportive of a great evening out!",5.0 star rating
Staff:The hostess had a fabulous look ..great style too bad she had a really unfriendly negative attitude.Our waitress was also not very friendly and seemed annoyed when we ask for items or even another drink. Food: The seafood was not as we expected. If you are gonna be a seafood restaurant we just expected  good quality fish. That didn't happen.Drinks: Frozen Margaritas reminded me of Baby A's not our favorite The cocktails that proceeded were much better but still a little too sweet. The restaurant was busy and others seems to enjoy it but we prob won't go back.,1.0 star rating
"I had been to Alcomar HH before for the margaritas and a few apps. It was a pretty decent experience, no complaints, but I hadn't went back so I wasn't exactly blown away. However, this past weekend WWWaustin posted Alcomar's new HH, which included $1 oysters all night Sunday-Monday. I was excited, and of course, so was the rest of Austin. We show up, sit down and order some queso and drinks. When the waiter comes back, we ask for the oysters. He lets us know they've been out and they're having more delivered that won't be here until an hour or so (turned into 2hours, we eventually left and went to Fresa's) I wanted to roll with it but couldn't help but think how many people were here for the oysters. The place was packed. Normally, the first thing a server says when they're out of something is just to let you know we're out of """"... and especially when you know this is why everyone is here. Just bad service. And it lets you know how out of touch they are with marketing/social media, if WWWaustin, who has over 70k followers posts your oyster HH, order more oysters. Oh, and they only have 1 margarita on their HH now, used to have all of them lol.",2.0 star rating

"Came for a bday party of 7 to celebrate my mom's bday at 5:30pm on a Friday. Happy hour lasts from 5-630pm which includes drinks and appetizers. However other reviews and signs mention 3-5pm so I'm not sure what's the right info.  Ambiance is romantic with dim lights and chill music. Great place for happy hour. As we got seated we were served with picked veggies and an orange sauce with tortilla chips. The tortilla chips were made quite well. Extremely crispy and thick. For appetizers we ordered oysters, flautitas, crispy calamari, and salmon ceviche. Out of all the appetizers from the happy hour menu we did not care for the flautitas. It reminded us of overpriced taquitos. Flounder entree- my stepdad didn't care for the raisins and wished the flounder had more seasoning as it tasted bland and cooked in butter. He mentioned that one side of the beans were lightly burnt like the cook forgot to flip them. He wished it had more salt & pepper. Shrimp & lobster poblano - my mom really liked this. Presentation isn't quite pretty, looks like a corn dog upon coming out depending on the length of the poblano pepper it's cooked in. Redfish in verde mole - the mole is dairy free, gluten free and no sugar according to our server. The redfish is pan seared with the skin on. I liked the combo of the verde mole and red fish and cubed butternut squash. It's very filling. Gulf coast Oysters- my hubby thought this was the best out of everything we ordered. Definitely come during happy hour for a dozen oysters for $17 since the regular price is $28+. It's a steal! It comes fresh as the restaurant receives them frequently (e.g. every other day) and not frozen. Lobster enchiladas- my sister ordered this and felt it had too many onions and that it was overpowering the lobster and taste of the dish. They're not able to separate out the onions since it's pre-made in the sauce prior so she ordered lobster tacos instead.Lobster tacos- for the price of $15, definitely not worth it but if you do order it, it's decent. Overall service was fantastic and our server, Kady was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They don't celebrate birthdays here but will give you a candle if you order a dessert on the menu.  The happy hour here is what drives the 4 star for me else I'd rate the restaurant 3.5 rating.",4.0 star rating
I love the atmosphere and the menu at Alcomar. I envision myself ordering just about anything from this menu from starters to mains! I had a casual margarita and app at the bar. The service was friendly. My margarita was frozen but not cheap frozen if you know what I mean. I had a half dozen oysters and they were well shucked and fresh! Can't wait to return!,5.0 star rating
"First of all, Alcomar is beautiful. Very, very beautiful. On my first visit to Alcomar, I just wasn't that impressed by the food. It was good, but not great! (Good enough that I'd try it again when I'm back in Austin, because I do love a seafood-heavy menu with a Latin angle.)I went with two friends for brunch. I got the chilaquiles (my go-to breakfast dish), and it was a good version of the dish - but not my favorite. The side of white beans were interesting, but maybe lacking a little salt? The service was good, and the restaurant is beautiful. I'd definitely give it another shot to really impress me, but my first impression was that it was looks over substance a little bit.",3.0 star rating

"I came here only for happy hour and appetizer.For the drink I ordered the Doña Rosa which has bourbon and tasted both boozy and sweet. It's a semi-strong tasting drink so don't expect it to be purely sweet. The Mango chipotle campechana was pretty delicious. Their chips with spicy, yet sweet sauce that they give you complementary is also really good.They also have a queso that comes with tortillas which was so delicious! The queso is fried on a pan so don't expect an actually queso ""dip.""I hope to return for an entree.",4.0 star rating
"Wow, I'm upset I hadn't stumbled upon this gem earlier! My husband and I went here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm. There was no wait and we were seated promptly, with our choice of table. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating - the outdoor has fans to help cool down the area on a typical Austin day! We started off our order with a bloody Mary (extra bacon) and the mezcal mule - both great and served quickly. We were then given some chips and pickled veggies w a side of dip (slightly spicy but really delicious). As far as the food - we ordered a dozen oysters, the octopus tostadas, a steak taco and a fish taco. The oysters were huge and awesome - served w some cholula cocktail sauce which was a nice touch. Also $1 oyster specials for brunch on Sat and Sunday until 3pm!! Can't beat that!! The octopus tostadas were awesome!!! Upset I didn't take a picture -  but we were starving and dove right in. Tacos, also both awesome. My husband preferred the steak. The corn tortillas are homemade. The steak has some jalapeno in it which adds a nice kick and add a bit of their hot sauce and you're on your way!! The service as a whole was excellent and we will definitely be back. Looking forward to trying other items off their menu!!",5.0 star rating

"We stopped in for dinner and even though we did not have reservations, we were immediately seated in a nice table on the patio.  Our waiter seemed a little preoccupied and busy but he did greet as after a little delay. Someone else brought some homemade chips and salsa to the table. - very tasty.  For our appetizer, we had panko crusted shrimp, shallots, escabeche, pickled xalapeño tartar, they came out quickly and cooked just right.  It is a big order served with an argula salad and could easily have been an entree.  For my entree, I ordered the butternut squash and lobster bisque which was delicious. I also had a side salad with bib lettuce, radishes, goat cheese and jicama served with a light vinaigrette dressing.  All very tasty.  My date had the ahi tuna tacos served al pastor style with pineapple, onion, cilantro and lime.  Simple, delicious and filling.  It is a little on the pricey side as most of the entrees range in the mid $20's and up, but all in all it was good quality food in a relaxed and pleasing environment.  I will probably go back and check out their happy hour.",4.0 star rating
"My FAVORITE place in town!! My husband and I eat once or twice a week in this place and will never get tired of it. I really encourage y'all to try EVERYTHING in the menu.

All the drinks are delicious and they have very interesting combinations, the dessert we love is the creme brûlée which they change every week.

"The good: The atmosphere is great for dinner. Fell in love with the menu! Wanted to try sooooo many things! Cocktails were pretty good. Had the coco margarita and it was good. Had the adobo grilled shrimp and it was DELICIOUS! The shrimp was a great size,  chargrilled to perfection. The adobo sauce with the spinach, potatoes and tortillas were magnificent! The bad: Service. One waitress left us and no one was taking care of our table for a LONG while. My date ordered his second martini and the glass was well below the half mark. When we brought it up to the ""new"" waitress, she just had another waiter come and tell us that's how drinks are and we were lucky with the first one. Their service overshadows how delicious the food is. Despite the bad service, will be trying it again hopefully the service isn't as bad!",2.0 star rating

"First, let us talk about the Margaritas.  I had two house margaritas:  one on the rocks and one frozen.  They were tasty but strong.  Glad I used Uber cause I may have been walking home.  If you drive, have one.  If you walk or take car service, have many.  But be warned, they are pricey.The queso is smooth and cheesy.  yes, cheesy is a word.  I thought it quite appealing, but they are really stingy with the tortillas.  If you want more tortillas, they charge extra.  Really? Yes, they do.Now let us talk about the crab guacamole.  Truly an interesting combo.  But what really makes it is the grilled pineapple.  The cooked oysters were quite scrumptious. A good appetizer for sure.Cerviche...well, pass on this one.All in all, a decent meal of appetizers.  Pricey though..Real pricey for what you get.  And they charge for tortillas....still cannot wrap my head around that one.TIP:Limited vegetarian options.Margaritas = strong",3.0 star rating

So I just gave a bigger tip.       She also says to let her know if I ever want to bring a group of people, like for a birthday brunch  and she will prepare a special table for us. And my birthday is April 7. Lol.       Keep making great tacos Flavia ! See you soon.",4.0 star rating
"Cheap, authentic Mexican food - everything that you could hope for. We need more places like this - family run restaurant, priced right with good flavor.Tacos are $2 a piece so I decided to try 3 of them. I got the bistec, carnitas and chicharron and all are pretty good. Today they only had corn tortillas, which saddened me at first, but these were amongst the better corn tortillas I've had in my life - its shocking that they're almost as soft and pliable as flour ones with better flavor. And the meats are pretty juicy and flavorful. Of the three, I liked the bistec the best - beefy, meaty flavor that's well seasoned. Chicarron probably comes in second - surprisingly spicy, yet flavorful but sadly loses that crispness that I like in my pig skin, which in turn made it chewy instead. The carnitas are alright.They cook everything to order, including making the tortillas fresh so it could take a while to get your food, so not the best place to go if you're in a rush but you will definitely get an amazing homemade meal if you're willing to stay.",4.0 star rating
"I happened to be walking our pups on a recent Saturday around noon and decided to stop by the El Primo trailer, corner So. 1st and W. Live Oak.  The line, as usual, was long.  So I glanced across the street and saw Flavia's trailer with just one person in line, so decided to try it.  And I'm glad I did!The Primo trailer is super popular and the three times I've been there the line has been very long and it takes more than 30 minutes to get your food once you've ordered, even if there isn't a line.  I won't be going back as long as Flavia's is across the street.I love tacos al pastor and it's the first thing I try in any new Mexican food place (Curra's Grill's are the best in Austin, fyi).  Flavia had them for $2 each.  The other fellow in line told me she makes her own corn AND flour tortillas (unusual!), so I ordered 2 tacos al pastor, one with a flour and one with a corn tortilla.  Service was quick, the plate was wrapped in foil,and I walked home to eat them.  Note that she has covered tables outside, so if you do eat there you aren't sitting in the hot sun - thinking ahead to summer.I must say they were delicious!  The tortillas were hearty and the filling was good, although she doesn't make her pastor with pineapple.  But the flavor was so good and the filling generous (there was more on the flour tortilla) that I didn't mind the lack of pineapple.  An authentic taco al pastor also should come with a green avocado sauce and hers didn't, but then, almost no restaurant outside Mexico serves the green sauce (except for Curra's).Reading through the yelp reviews, I'm going to try a breakfast taco or two next time I go there.There were two people in line when I left, so hopefully people are finding out about her great food and low prices, even if it's simply people who don't want to hassle with El Primo.She's on the SE corner of Live Oak and So. First Sts, btw.  There's a car service place there.Oh, and she takes credit cards, as most trailers do these days.",4.0 star rating

I will have to say I enjoyed the service the most our server made the visit worth while my two favorite things on the menu were the Arasina Roso and the complimentary Foccacia bread however if butter is not your thing the bread would not be your fare .

"My second time at this restaurant for brunch. Last time I went they had a $5 for unlimited mimosas deal, now they have $1 mimosas and Bellini's. The Bellini's are so yummy!! It was a perfect day to eat outdoors so we decided to seat outside. The waiter was a little slow and we had to ask him for bread a few times. The food was very good. I got the eggs al Forno??

She opted for a mimosa then a Bellini, which were both only $1! I got the Breakfast Calzone which was stuffed with eggs, sausage, bacon, cheese, spinach, and potatoes. It was so filling, I could only eat half, and took the rest home for breakfast the next day. My friend got the Eggs and Polenta, which she said was yummy. The bill came, which was a little higher than I am used to paying for brunch, but as good as the food and drinks were, it was worth the price.

"Taverna Focaccia and Italian Sausage pizza's with a cold Kellerweis beer is all you need to include your friends with for a good time.  I do not travel in town often, but I spent a recent moment or so at City Hall engaged with the Parks & Recreation Board for a city meeting to improve our parks by including more Disc Golf, activity areas, trails, and bringing improvements to under served areas.  After the event we needed a celebratory location, welcome the Taverna. We know people that work here and now we see why; the food is great.  The place is a great little spot if you are looking for a quick location for drinks & eats with friends before a busy night out or as a place that you can close the day with as a casual hangout as we did.  We were able to catch the Happy Hour posted from 4-7pm and got half-priced drinks and appetizers; it was perfect for our needs and budget, the money saved went into more drinks & eats of course.  The Taverna Focaccia pizza is AMAZING and is often overlooked. Being I have lived in Germany and Europe for many years, I truly enjoyed an authentic ""rustic"" pizza that was NOT laden with sauces and excess cheese. It is a rare combination to find: hand-made fired pizza crust, hand shaven cheese, aged prosciutto, the tangy fresh flavor of arugula, and the finish crunch of pine nuts.  Truly good.. and at half price? Really? That's why we ordered the Italian Sausage Pizza as well.. money saved went to that.   It was amusing when some in our group looked at the Taverna Focaccia like it was a salad on crusty bread...until they tasted it; then they wished they didn't order the other pizza. Don't get me wrong.. the Italian Sausage pizza was great... but spend a moment and step away from the sauces & cheese and taste a great Taverna Focaccia pizza.  As you would expect the wine, beer, drinks, and staff were great during our time.. but I needed to ensure you learned about the Taverna Focaccia and the place as a great day ending or evening beginning location....mmm now I am ready for it all over a again.",4.0 star rating

"Worse experience EVER! I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend for brunch and we will NEVER EVER go back. Service was below poor level and food was simply horrible. We arrived and waited to be seated for about 40' but we knew it was busy so we decided to stay. After waiting for about 15-20' for a server to take our order, we finally had a glass of water pored in front of us. Huge relief considering the hight temperatures. Finally, after about 1 HOUR! of wait, we got our food. I ordered a spinach and cheese omelette that came with red potatoes on the side. I took my first bite and realized my food was cold. It literally looked like my dish has been seating out forever. (the food looked overcooked and re heated). The stomach ache that followed from eating that one bite completed my dissatisfaction about this place. Don't waste your money in this place. It isn't worth it.",1.0 star rating
"Don't get me wrong, the food here is good, but I have to knock off two stars for portion size and pricing. I understand the Lombardi name = higher price points and I don't mind paying it, but at least serve me enough food so I can leave satisfied.With that said, the food that is served to you is good. I've never ordered anything that tasted bad here. I would recommend their risottos (specifically the frutti di mare and capesante). For the pastas, I usually go with either the Scampi Tagliolini, Paglia E Fieno, or the Fettucine Frutti Di Mare. If you can't tell by all the Frutti Di Mare things, I really like seafood. The foccacia bread is also very cheesy, crispy, and delicous.For weekend brunch, I'll usually come here for the cheap $2 mimosas and bellinis (which used to be $1... i know... twice as as expensive now to start your morning off right. There's usually specials along the wall above the bar too and during brunch, their hash is pretty satisfying.I would not recommend coming here as a big group because service will be slow. Even with just 4-6 people, we waited about 30 minutes before getting our food, and some appetizers came out after our main dishes.Parking can suck, but if you're here for brunch on the weekends, park at the City Hall garage around the block.

"Overpriced and bland.Mussels were incredibly bland, zero seasoning and there were only 12 in the $15 serving. Yes, they were nicely cooked but no flavor and not enough to justify the price tag.Veal marsala at $24 was also not good value for money. Sauce had reasonable marsala flavor but way too many mushrooms and way to little veal with was borderline dry, small and not melt in the mouth tender which should be the hallmark of veal. Came with scalloped potatoes which were tasty and I liked them but were overcooked.Bruscheta for $8 was no more than a few slices of toasted bread and a pile of diced tomatoes.The location was good and the ambiance on a Monday evening was just right.

I had just the simple focacia as an appetizer and, while it started out nice and warm and chewy and perfectly ""pizza without the fun"", as it cooled it became so crisp and hard it was too hard to chew. I ordered the eggs benedict over crabmeat which I will ALWAYS order, anywhere, as long as it's on the menu. The hollandiase was skimpy and both my eggs were undercooked to a point I couldn't eat them at all. I liked the fried potatoes that came with. My companion didn't like his eggs but that was his fault for being a moron and ordering them ""over hard""... over hard = slab of rubber, genius. Of course you didn't like them. Over all, I'll go back for their brunch based expressly on their prices . Also, every Tuesday they have 1/2 off all bottles of wine.",3.0 star rating

"Got my first taste of Texas hospitality here... To be fair, the staff was pleasant enough and I did not get an opportunity to try the menu, and here is why. I've been in Austin for 3 weeks now, enjoying the people and food a lot. I wanted brunch and decided to try Taverna in downtown .... The place was packed for a table so I was told to try and find and empty seat at the bar.  A couple left in front of me so I grabbed  the empty chair, here is when it gets fun. The chair was quickly yanked right out my hands. This woman comes from behind me holding a drink and slides both chairs over to herself and block me out. I said ""excuse me"" and she continued to ignore me and act like I wasn't even there.  I said ""excuse me again""  ... Finally she turns around and tells me her friend is in the bathroom and she needs two chairs, also I am rude for trying to sit because she had been waiting even longer than I was, apparently she is so important I should realize she is a) somewhere in the crowd behind me and b) waiting for a seat and c) needs two, one for herself and the invisible friend in the bathroom. I told her that if she  would have just looked me in the eyes like a person and said that she had been waiting there at the very beginning that would have been okay with me, I would have understood. But to treat me like I wasn't there was rude and not okay with me. She said she had moved the chair out my way so I could clean the bar and didn't know I was there to eat, and that I was rude for speaking up to her like I was. Okay ""wow"" ; how can I not take that statement the wrong way coming from an angry white woman with a southern accent. At this point I was so mad I had to walk away. I told her she didn't have a right to treat anyone like that and treat people like they are invisible. Looked around me and it was a whole lot of white people at this brunch so I left. I went to eat next door to eat at Jos where being a Latino with tattoos seems to be okay with people. 2014, stay classy Texas.",1.0 star rating

"We used to go here a lot when they first opened years ago.  I hadn't been in a few years and I must say the quality of food was a disappointment.  The service was good, but unfortunately most of our food had no flavor.  I ordered the Salmon Puttanesca.  The salmon was cooked well but did not have much flavor.  My husband ordered the Pagila E Fieno and he sad the same.  We were both adding salt and pepper to add taste.  The only thing that had flavor was the aioli sauce for the calamari.  Unfortunately the crème brulee was a disappointment too.  The sugary top was not crispy and not done correctly.Sad to write this review because the service was good and I love how cute the restaurant ambience is, but we do not plan to go back for food.",2.0 star rating
"Taverna was....so/so. I mean I liked the outdoor seating section, and I liked the fact that it was covered, because I'm not a fan of eating right out on the sidewalk when people pass by. Our waiter wasn't horrible, but seemed EXTREMELY uncomfortable. I kid you not he spent 5 minutes rattling off specials, and had a hard time remembering some of them. But I don't blame him, it seemed like the specials list was longer than the menu itself. But yes he seemed incredibly skittish and rarely made eye contact making it a bit uncomfortable. He brought us out bread which was decent, and I was happy to see that there was accompanying balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I started with the caesar salad which I actually liked a LOT more than my main dish. Maybe it's my fault for ordering spaghetti carbonara, a dish I tend to steer clear of, but I thought hey why not? It's Texas. Wrong. It was overwhelmingly creamy and I'm positive the ""bacon"" was in fact bacon bits. For the amount we paid here, I would expect them to use actual bacon, and if they DID use actual bacon, then there's something monumentally wrong with it. I didn't finish it, and I was starving. I just couldn't force myself too eat it. Instead of spreading around the bacon, there was a GIGANTIC concentration of it on top of the pasta. Yuck. The caesar salad and bread was enough for me to add another star. But the main dish was a let down and the service at many points made me feel uncomfortable, NOT a good sign.If I lived in Austin, I might try it out for brunch, but as far as the dinner menu is concerned, I would gladly pass it up.",2.0 star rating
"I absolutely love Taverna. I eat here often. I visited this past Sunday for brunch around 1:30 PM and was seated immediately (yay!). I decided to try something other than my usual California Pizza or Paglia. I went with the breakfast calzone - filled with eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, onions, spinach, mozzarella, and marinara sauce. HOLY CRAP IT WAS A GAME CHANGER. It was amazing. Also, $1.85 mimosas/bellinis that are really refreshing.The service is always great and the food is delicious! Definitely my go-to restaurant in Austin.",5.0 star rating
"Food was okay, but other than buying brunch the prices are pretty expensive. One of thr girls in my party got ravoli and the portions was extremly small especially with the $17.00 price tag. I ordered the eggs benedict with crab meat, it def was not fresh so again it was okay. The other people in my party got the hash ans that was decent. Overall i probably would only come back for the two dolloar mimosas and peach belinis for brunch but the food was nothing special.",3.0 star rating

"The South Congress spot is more my style. Perhaps I am nostalgic about it because of the good times I've spent there with friends. The Downtown location is not your classic Austin Jo's experience, but something its own. The development of downtown has driven off many of the classic Austin spots that helped define Austin as a weird, or at the very least bohemian, sort of town. Anyone remember the cinnamon coffee at Las Manitas? So now we have the tony and the antiseptic. A true Austin vibe has been drained away, the brambles and overgrowth of non-conformity have been cut back, and the whole place has come to feel very much like a generic downtown in any American city. Jo's downtown location inside has preserved a bit of the old Austin feel. Independent. Understated. Clean. Not for the Biff-and-Buffy crowd. The coffee is quite good. The breakfast tacos -- the potato, egg and cheese is the best of them - are the size of a three egg omelet wrapped in a thin flour tortilla for easy, grease free stuffing of said omelet in your face. One taco is enough at the downtown location. Two will be required at the South Congress shop. The have the craziest, most delicious cinnamon rolls. (Yes, they are from Quack's . . . but no matter.) You should try one of them. They are chewy to the tooth but tender inside and coated with a layer of cinnamon and sugar. If you squint your eyes, you can pretend that the tony boutiques across the street aren't there, that time and progress have not swept away a lot Austin character. Inside Jo's you can still imagine what it would be like back in the day.",4.0 star rating
"Oh Jo's. I really wanted to like you. ...But after two visits to your downtown location in less than a week, I have learned my lesson, and will not be returning to this location. Four stars for the coffee, but everything else is lacking.The Spread: At a glance, the menu looks great. Tacos, burgers, salads, coffee... And fun variations on basic menu items, like the ""Crazy Carl,"" a breakfast taco with refried beans, fried avocado, pico de gallo and cotija cheese.The Scene: Bustling, bright, well-lit, casual place with plenty of tables, counter space and outside seating.The Service: YIKES. The staff who take your order are friendly enough. But the service was S-L-O-W. The first time we ordered, we waited for more than 25 minutes for our food. It's only fair to acknowledge that their computer systems seemed down, so they were having trouble running tickets. But on the second visit, the service took at least 20 minutes. And what's more frustrating is that they got my order wrong on both occasions! On the first visit, they forgot to omit an ingredient, but the second visit, they gave me the wrong item entirely. Sadness.",2.0 star rating

"In Austin for the day. This place was suggested by a lady at the Radisson Hotel nearby. We had tea/soda, fried avocado burgers and fries. The fries were enough for two or three to share.

"We were visiting Austin and tried  this place for some late breakfast on a Saturday morning.  After we ordered we realized we had to scrounge around for a table.  Luckily someone was getting up and we were able to jump in there before anyone else could snatch it up.  We then had to wait a decent amount of time for someone to come and clean off the mess left by the last occupants.Then came the 40 minute wait until our food arrived at our table. That is a long time to wait for breakfast.  Especially for just an order of french toast and yogurt. The french toast was decent, but definitely not worth a 40 minute wait. My wife was pretty disappointed with her overpriced yogurt.",2.0 star rating

"I don't know why Joe's is changing for the worse. I live close by so have breakfast here often and have noticed that the to-go breakfast tacos have about 1/3 of the love compared to those when you dine-in (even though they are the same price).I went there for lunch yesterday and they were not staffed for the amount of business that they were having. It took 40 minutes to get my meal which I understand, they were busy but I heads up or fyi would have gone a long way. We saw a number of patrons leaving the restaurant with incomplete orders because everything was taking so long.",3.0 star rating
"I highly recommend the Broken Yolk Sandwich and an Iced Belgian Bomber.I live in the apartment over Jo's and absolutely love it. Prior to living in the same building, I had only experienced a latte from their SoCo location but am so glad that it is now a regular part of my routine.They are really great about remembering who is a regular and what their drink choice is. It's so convenient and I love the staff. It's got to be a tough place to work dealing with people who ""haven't had their coffee yet"" and are always in a rush to be somewhere important. I will say that a couple staff members can be bitter and ruin it for everyone but there's always one (or two) bad apples, right?",5.0 star rating

"Although I've had countless Belgian Bombers from the SoCo location, this is my first time at the location downtown. I wasn't even aware they pretty much had a full menu here! Salads, burgers, beer & wine and BREAKFAST!!I came on a Saturday morning around 9:45 and there was a small wait at the register. I ordered chorizo, egg and cheese taco with avocado and my boyfriend got the migas plate. Around $4 and $9 dollars respectively.  We both ordered large Belgian Bombers too. We waited around 30 minutes for our food which is fair enough since they only got more busy while we were there. The food was spectacular. My single taco was very filling and the chorizo wasn't super greasy or paste-like compared to other places around town. The Migas plate was huge! The side of black beans may have been the best I've ever had. Very flavorful with a hint of spice. I highly recommend this place. You may have to wait a bit longer on the weekends but the food makes up for the wait.",4.0 star rating
"Went here based off of a suggestion by a friend. We came for the breakfast tacos but we arrived at 11:04 so we were told we could not order off of the breakfast menu.

My friend really enjoyed the Turkey Sandwich and I thought the Pulled Pork was just okay. I also ordered the IcedTurbo coffee, it tasted like a bottled coffee drink that you could buy at any convenience store.

"Breakfast only until 12pm on the weekends?? Come on Austin, get it together. Got caught in a line out the door around 11. Cashier was friendly enough taking our orders but a 30-40 minute wait for yogurt and french toast? You need to hire more cooks or extend the breakfast/brunch time to accommodate those who come in before it ends.Extremely disappointed with my tiny and overpriced yogurt/granola/berries since it was almost $10. Granola was a little chewy and I got like 4 strawberries. My husband's french toast was delicious though.I guess Austin is just laid back but I'd rather be seated by a hostess than try to scrounge for seats when it's packed.

"My husband is a major foodie. Literally our vacations are built around cities with reputations for good food- fancy or casual, we don't discriminate. On a recent trip to ATX my husband researched restaurants and found La Condesa. I was super excited after looking on Yelp but disappointed when the meal was over. Pros: Modern interior and design. Awesome build out! Nice service staff. Decent prices for a nice restaraunt. Good bartenders and cocktails. Cons: We arrived to the restaurant during heavy rain. Our initial table and seats were wet due to a roof leak and awkwardly placed next to a giant indoor plant. Like awkward enough that it was hanging over you. Just a piece of advise to management. Ditch the plant. It served no purpose where it's place and seems intrusive. Perhaps another spot would be better. BTW this was a four person table along the window by the patio. The menu was small and there were no specials off menu. They were also out of 2-3 top sellers. The dessert! This is what sealed the deal on my disappointment. My husband is a meat guy and I'm sweets person. I love dessert and I literally hated this dessert. I can't remember the name but it was the equivalent of a chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream. I believe it was served in a flan type dish. The chocolate cake had a pepper or spice in it. It was the worst identity crisis I've ever put in my mouth. Not that having an entree with ghost peppers wasn't enough but to put it in my dessert too? It should be a crime to do that. I digress....but, before I do that I must tell you I shared my thoughts with the waiter. (He asked!) I got the impression he agreed the dessert was odd based on his non verbals.  In summary, if you like Mexican food with a high end flare give this place a try. Note most dishes have a spice to them. The Mexican street corn looked awesome. I was admiring it from another table but did not order it myself. However, unless you like spicy chocolate cake save yourself the $10 bucks or whatever it was.",3.0 star rating
"In all honesty, boyfriend and I only visited because we had heard of their legendary margaritas, but I can say that we didn't leave disappointed by any of it!Other reviewers are correct in saying that it is pricey for each portion. However, if you understand that they are intending these to be shared things and that you should order multiple items to be satisfied, you will be fine! It may not make the price better, but to each their own! Our waitress did a great job explaining this, so we were satisfied in the end :)Now, the food! Each of us got a Masa plate, along with the shared queso flameado, elotes, and chips/salsa. The chips were great and had four salsas, all of which were really good! I appreciated that they were explained, and that there was a variety. The elotes (Mexican street corn), as mentioned by others, was delicious. It really is messy though, so be prepared! Queso flameado was nothing to write home about, but was yummy.We both enjoyed our masa plates as well-- mine was the tamal (which boyfriend said was in his top two tamales ever... And he is from the valley!) and his was the huarache de panza de puerco, which was good but had a VERY strong blue cheese flavor.We got their dulce de leche from the dessert menu... Oh my gosh. That was so rich, but all of the flavors were perfect and amazing. I wouldn't recommend eating one by yourself though- I think it would be too much to handle eventually.Finally... The margarita. So. Damn. Good. That was the smoothest margarita I have ever had. The salt on the rim was a little different, so even as someone who doesn't like a salted rim, I am glad I had this one! Just get one. Don't question it.Overall, I really enjoyed my experience! The food was great, the staff was amazing, and the atmosphere was awesome. Take some time to check it out :)",4.0 star rating

"Before I begin with the ""what could have been better"" portion of my review - I would like to say kudos to La Condesa on atmosphere and service. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing and they were very accommodating as we had to push out our reservation and then ended up coming in late for it. Service was fantastic, quick, nice, and to the point. I'd also like to point out that our waiter looked like a darker Johnny Depp. One can't be mad at that. My Margarita La Classica was delicious and hit the spot - loved the lemongrass salt rim!Ok so here are my ""what could have been done betters."" 1) The guacamole portion was teeny tiny and didn't taste fresh. It came in a teacup for $12. Pricing is not the issue as I live in Manhattan, but even there we get better guacamole and more of it for that price. Austin is closer to both California and Mexico. No excuse!2) My Hongos something something Huitlacoche was just ok and teeeeeeeeeny. I've never seen anything that small for $16. 3) Salad portion sizes were also tiny and just ok.The Brussels Sprouts were the best part of the meal. Very tasty. Overall, this meal was just ok. Nothing special. It's a shame because if the food and portion sizes had been better - this would be a great restaurant. A little disappointing.",3.0 star rating
"""Haha, the Feds can't touch us now, boys!  We've got this sweet set up, they'll never find us down here.  Hell, they can't find their own ass with a bloodhound.  But this, this is genius.  Cool, quiet and hidden.  We'll set up the booze on this side, see, and then take the tunnel under the street to our decoy business on the other side.  Hell, the guvment did us a favor with this Prohibition bullshit.  We're gonna make a mint!  Fuck the Feds!  Here's to Prohibition!!!""  This is the scene that played out in my head as I checked out La Condesa's underground private party rooms. Oh, you didn't know they had that right?  Neither did I, until we came here late one night, 10 minutes to closing, with a group of 6, and not only did they graciously invite us to dine, but they also turned on the lights in The Tunnel for us to check it out (btw, 5 stars for the service, still 4 for for the food.  The tortilla soup was icky, very almost creamy tomatoey, and the cochinita tacos were tasty if greasy).What a great place for a Prohibition Party!  The first room has a Foosball table, a stellar liquor cabinet that lights the bottles and really cool artwork.  Then you duck (low ceilings) into the next room where they have a table set up to feed 18 comfortably.  The only drawback for me would be remembering to duck my head  through the doorways after 5 martinis.Apparently, contrary to my fantasy, this was actually called a Flour Room where dry goods were stored, and there used to be a tunnel that ran under the street to where Lamberts is now, which used to be a general store.  It's a very interesting and historical looking area, with it's bricked walls and low rounded doors.  Very secret.  Very sexy.  Very ""Boardwalk Empire"".  Makes me wanna put a feather in my hair, a filter on my cig, pearls on my neck and garters on my thighs with a Derringer tucked in nicely.  ohhhh yeeeeahhhhh......",4.0 star rating

"A friend and I were going to an ACL Live taping and decided to give La Condesa a try. We decided to eat in the bar because we weren't the first ones with this idea. We ordered the guacamole sampler, hamachi ceviche, and I believe (it was not easy to recognize because it was covered in baked/slightly burnt cheese) the Cochinita Pibil taquitos. The guacamole sampler was good - you will need to ask for more chips, though. The hamachi ceviche was excellent but it's definitely not your traditional ""cut-up"" ceviche. My friend had to literally chop up the hamachi, avocado, etc. so that we could share it and eat it with chips. The taquitos tasted good except for the burnt cheese - maybe go easier on the cheese next time? Otherwise, it was  decent. I wouldn't say it was the best place I've ever eaten but the food is good enough. We walked out of there about 78 dollars later and I didn't have a drink, so be prepared.",3.0 star rating

We also got the pork belly which was extremely dry and tough, and we sent back. The chef felt that the texture and cooking was fine but made us a new one. The new one was slightly better.The branzino was pretty good. I'll give it 3 stars. Drinks were meh - we got a margarita and a spicy something. The salt was nice, I'll give it that. Service was weird, the guy was not super friendly and then he said could bring us some salsas. But then charged us for it. At that point I didn't bother complaining.

"This was our last stop before leaving Austin and we were floored at how meh it was.  Salsas were good, but deserved a homemade tortilla chip for a better finish.

The amount of brunching ladies is not, I repeat, is not a sign that the food is good.  Points given for good service, informed staff and atmosphere.  Sit inside for a blah experience without exhaust fumes. Limes seemed to be on strike, they were seriously dry but the habanero was good n spicy-truly transcendental. Then again, that's what you would expect from a habanero.At this point, we just can't wait to get home and forget about it.  I agree with the previous reviewer that also felt robbed of a good Austin meal, next time we'll just go to a taco truck.",3.0 star rating

We walked by and saw they had a few ceviche options and opted to give it a try. I had been here years ago but did not remember the food.... Probably because of trying out their array of different drinks that day. Not your classic Austin 'Mexican martini' place, but they have a huge tequila selection. We just did a margarita and some Mexican beer. With regards to service... Fantastic, though our server seemed frazzled with a large table nearby. She did send out an extra taquito plate that was one of our favorite things! For food the ceviche we got was not traditional but tasted so good, and still like ceviche. The taquitos were yummy, and the yellowfin tuna was our favorite flavored dish. If you like desserts we ordered the coffee cheesecake... So original and YUM!",4.0 star rating
"I've been here a few times. once for margaritas and recently for dinner.  I think La Condesa has one of the best margaritas in town probably because of salt concoctions they use.For a downtown upscale place, the prices are in line, but the portions could be more. Dinner and service was actually quite good which reading some the reviews here tells me La Condesa probably needs more consistency -  one of the hardest things for restaurants. Service was professional /personable from all of the 5 or so people that attended our table. ELOTES - street corn, COLES DE BRUSELAS - Brussels sprouts, COLIFLOR A LA PLANCHA - roasted cauliflower, HUARACHE DE HONGOS Y HUITLACOCHE - roasted wild mushrooms ROUTE STOCK PINOT NOIR - Willamette 2013 The Brussels were roasted and my favorite dish even though it's a side. Uchi/Uchiko has one of the best Brussels in my opinion and theirs is right along with them. Mix it with the roasted corn and you have a fabulous side. I wasn't as impressed with the wild mushrooms but my vegan GF loved it. We both enjoyed the roasted cauliflower - the price of it ($18) not so much.  The mark up on that dish must be 1000% :)  anyway we thought there was an off menu secret vegan dish that other yelpers mentioned but our server didn't know anything about it...  and when we made reservations we mentioned we wanted a vegan dish but my guess is that message didn't make it t the chef.  All in all I would say 3.5 stars.  Yelp really should make half stars available. La Condesa was not average but was not exceptional either.  I'd go there again but with all the choices in town it would not be on the top of the list.",4.0 star rating

I was like, you kidding right? The ""Chef"" will not alter or take anything off the ""food', in this case the tacos. I was like, OK. So, I told the waiter, here are your tacos, let me pay for it, and keep them, because they are bad anyways. You probably need the money too. No big deal.

"La Condesa is the epitome of stylish, upscale Mexican and is oh so delicious. I came for their happy hour and was impressed with their happy hour prices. If it were not for their happy hour prices, I think everything would have been a bit overpriced.What we got on the happy hour menu:* Guacamole Tasting - this was a tasting of all of their salsas +guacs, and it was tasty! Great varied options. Portions of each tasting are small but unique. Loved the one with the chipotle + toasted almond, mmmmmm hungry just thinking about it.* Watermelon-Elderflower Martini - wouldn't usually have a vodka drink at a Mexican restaurant but this one spoke right to my heart; enjoyed the St. Germain and watermelon combo* Alma Blanca - unique flavors that work well together! Love the spice of the habanero and citrus infusionI have to give this place 3 stars however because there is such minimal happy hour seating that we showed up pretty much when happy hour started and barely got a seat. It is a large restaurant so I feel like they can allocate more seating for happy hour, especially because the rest of the restaurant was basically empty and happy hour seems to be a lot more popular with their patrons. I get that it is downtown but still. The prices just would not be worth it if it were not for happy hour, so unfortunately I don't know if I will be able to make it back here.Overall great food and drinks, but not worth paying full price for. I would definitely return here again, if I knew I could get a happy hour seat.",3.0 star rating
"My family visited Trace this week for their Lunch on the Go menu: an offering of sandwiches that come with the soup and salad of the day. Trace excels in the details. The complimentary fried chickpea appetizer was crunchy, greaseless, subtly-spiced and completely divine. The salad was full of roasted winter veg and lightly dressed. The creamy artichoke soup balanced substance with velvety softness. It had a fresh herb oil and frizzled artichoke leaf on top. If only we had stopped there.  All three of the sandwich options: brisket with cheese and onion strings, chicken breast with camembert and pineapple salsa and veggie pakora burger, fell far short of their tantalizing descriptions. Let me tell you, these folks know how to write a menu!Not only were they anemic in portion (understandable in a meal deal, but not when all the accompaniments are also tiny, and you're charging $16 a plate), but they also had either tough or completely soggy bread, and overall dry fillings. I look forward to giving them another try for a less hurried--and boy, they WERE speedy--and unabbreviated meal.",3.0 star rating
"For New Year's 2011 my husband decided to treat me to a mini staycation by booking us a room at the W. We were upgraded to the SUITE...and it was just lovely!!! I loved the decor in the room. The gray walls, the beautiful gray couch with multicolored pillows of assorted sizes, the beautiful textured wall paper and the AMAZING view of downtown Austin! The complimentary Sofia champagne in the room was a nice touch as well :-) A group of our friends joined us in our suite to celebrate the New year. After several drinks, we went downstairs to Trace for dinner. I ordered the Pork Belly small plate and it was truly amazing. For my entree, I ordered the Rib Eye. We shared a charcuterie plate and bread along with several mustards -- all very good. The verdict?Decor = 5Food =4Price =2 (It's expected that prices will be high because it is inside the W, but for the amount of food you are getting, they either need to lower the price or increase the portions)Service = 4Overall = 4 starsI enjoyed the ambiance, the food, and the company! It was trendy and reminded me of Los Angeles -- makes me miss living in LA! I'm sure my husband and I will be back!",4.0 star rating
"Overall, I was disappointed at Trace, I really wanted to like this place. I had high hopes for this place as it had the contemporary look and a place you'd sit down for a glass of wine and chill. I went here for a group lunch and we got that big appetizer board which had exotic things like fried octopus, cheese, rabbit, smoked sausage, and so forth. Very tasty, very satisfying. Unfortunately, that was the only good part of the experience.First off, the booth was incredibly uncomfortable. It was angled in a very awkward way and the chair my friend sat in was likewise discomforting. Also, from what everyone said at the table, the lunch entrées were mediocre. I got the hand-crafted pizza and was sorely disappointed. It was too salty and the crust was very tough. The service was prompt and professional and I'd come back here for the appetizers and some wine, but I'll pass on the lunch and dinner menus.",2.0 star rating
"A friend and I went to Trace Saturday night, so I thought I would post a review. This is the new restaurant in the W across from City Hall. Perhaps most notable is that this is one of the first, if not the first restaurants in Austin to feature an on staff forager. We started with a citrus hamachi that was the highlight of the meal, and a charcuterie board. Trace's charcuterie features meat only, no cheese-perhaps this is traditional, but I guess I file it in the bang for your buck category. Entrees were a crispy fish, and I had some sort of chicken with liver, cider and grits dish that never really took off. Finally, dessert was a cobbler with some sort of yummy herb-infused ice cream. Obviously, the meal wasn't that memorable. Total damage was $60 per person, no alcohol. Service was good to outstanding. Part of the problem is that the food has to overcome the atmosphere. When you walk in you have to go through this huge scene of people waiting to get into the club next door. And while the restaurant side was fairly insulated from the club, at least a couple of times the DJ would be cranking things up and it was kind of out of place. Also, the bathrooms serve the club as well, so expect a line!This is a pretty new restaurant, so growing pains are inevitable. At this price though, Olivia does the same thing much better, IMHO.",2.0 star rating
"*Disclaimer* --This is a review for a dining experience prior to the glass-falling-from-patios W. (And, maybe it's too soon to be dogging a place that recently underwent all of that, but sorry, the food still wasn't that great.)Free food, schmee food. Maybe that makes me a snob; but am I asking for too much when I say that if someone is paying for the dinner and it's That much, it should be damn better than decent?In a word-- it was Bland. And I'm not one to call food bland. I'm no lover of oversalting or overseasoning anything-- I'm a lover of simple flavors and well executed five-or-less ingredient dishes, but when every dish could use ""just a little something extra"" then something might be wrong.Most memorable: the service, the company, the ambience, and the MacMurray Pinot.--Ok, I'll be nice: the snapper, but probably only because of the fennel (or the artichoke?), maybe the fish stick, too. In another word, it was overrated (before glass started falling from their patios). There was about one ingredient--if that--per dish that stood out. (My favorite, pickled fennel: simple, yet amazing.) For a place as schwanky as the W, I want Every ingredient to stand out. Come on Austin food scene! Impress me! Give me something to rave about instead of something to rant about.",2.0 star rating
"Trendy, plush, and chic.  The ambiance is exactly what I'd imagined a restaurant inside the W Hotel would be (except for the fact that the the cushy white chairs are a tad reminiscent of a toilet seat)!  The food wasn't exactly a ""party-in-the-mouth"" or memorable, but I appreciated the fact that their menu changed and they used local, fresh ingredients.  The presentation for all the dishes were well done, but don't be expecting to be full when you walk out unless you plan on spending some $$$.  I ordered the Grilled Gulf Redfish with sweet potato puree, sesame mustard greens, and soy ginger emulsion - from a scale of one to ten I'm giving it a 6.  The fish was a little ""fishy"" tasting and was a tad overcooked for my liking.   The sweet potato puree was creamier and thinner than a traditional puree, and the greens were probably the most interesting tasting thing on my plate.  Although I love my veggies, I think it says something when your greens stand out more than the ""star"" ingredient of the dish (the fish).  I've been here for happy hour and it's reasonably priced while you get enjoy sitting in a swanky, well-decorated interior.  Everyone here is ridiculously good looking, including the wait staff, so dress to impress if you care to ""fit in"".   I'd be open for going back for brunch, but it's not someplace I'm telling my friends THEY JUST HAVE TO TRY.",3.0 star rating
"We went to Trace before the Pet Shop Boys concert (been several times before), and while there was nothing terribly bad about our meal, I expect more for $140. The food was good, but not great (small portions as always which aren't a problem but really exasperate the cost when things aren't wonderful), and our waiter seemed to disappear as the meal progressed. Drink refills took 15 minutes, and after appetizers and entrees we didn't have time for dessert and coffee because the meal had already taken 90 minutes. I generally expect better things here.",3.0 star rating

"I hate to do it.  I hate to give this beautiful restaurant 2 stars.  But I have to.  My first experience, while probably not indicative of the majority, was actually a 1-star experience had it not been for the culinary talent.  The food here is absolutely phenomenal, however, food quality and presentation can't carry the entire weight.  Service was the weakest link.I had been excited to try Trace as it had been on my radar for awhile.  The menu looked very enticing and I am all about local purveyors of product which the menu screams.I made my reservation through OpenTable like I always do for restaurants of this caliber.  I always request larger tables in the reservation notes section just to see if the maitre'd or hostess actually pays attention to the notes, which is indicative of how much they care about the small details.  Upon arrival, the valet was prompt and courteous.  It is $7 for valet if you are dining.  Initially, no one was present at the host stand for a few minutes.  After the hostess greeted us and located my reservation, she took us to a table I specifically noted I didn't want(a two-top table).  I asked for a larger table, which was available, and she granted the request.  The restaurant was busy and clearly understaffed.  We sat for about 10 minutes before one of the server assistants noticed us and poured water.  He asked if anyone had been helping us, to which I replied no, and he said he would get someone to.  A server came to our table shortly after, did not introduce himself, did not welcome us to the restaurant, did not explain a single thing about the menu or make a single recommendation, and did not even try to sell anything off the wine list.  I like to be sold when dining out, and if I had been looking to buy that Jerobaum of Dom P. for $3000, he would have REALLY missed out.  He was an order taker the whole night.  I think he had just too many tables to take care of, or he saw a young couple and didn't think he had to deliver friendly and engaging service.  Unfortunately for him and Trace, I am a five-star fine-dining and luxury hotel veteran, and I will call you out on a bad experience.We ordered the Market Snacks, which is a selection of cheeses, spreads, and charcuterie.  Since I knew what everything was on the menu, I didn't have any questions and didn't NEED an explantion of anything, however, I kept thinking what if I were a guest who didn't have advanced culinary knowledge?  The runner that delivered the Market Snacks DID explain everything, in fact, he said more in his description of that dish than our server said to us all night.  I will say that the appetizer was the BEST cheese and charcuterie plate I've ever had, and I've had some pretty phenomenal ones in my life.  We ordered the Strip Steak and Grouper for our entrees, which were both cooked correctly and delicious.  The smashed sea salt potatoes were pretty fabulous, and it's generally hard to impress me with any potato side.  Our server did stop to ask if everything was good, and we affirmed we were satisfied with our dishes.  By the time we had finished with our entrees, business had slowed down.   We declined to look at the dessert menu, because our orignal plan was to go to Truluck's for dessert.  Our server brought us a complimentary dessert with the check and apologized for our long greet time.  It was a nice attempt to recover on a guest, although too little too late.  Every restaurant always tries to recover with a free dessert, generally when all you want to do is get out of there after a bad experience.  Try something else!  I think the staff knew they had fumbled on me because as we were leaving, the hostess asked in a nervous voice if everything had been OK.  Yes, it was OK at best and only because the cuisine was amazing.  Oh, and the MECHANICS(water refilled, clearing of plates before next course, correct silverware placement) of service were also spot on.  I REALLY REALLY wanted to enjoy this place, however, the experience was disappointing.  It will take awhile for me to give them a second chance.",2.0 star rating
"""Can I get something for you?"" and ""What would you like?"" Those were the only words spoken by our waiter. We went with another couple for ARW, as the menu looked to be one of the best this time around. I had actually heard mixed reviews from others so I went in with an open (leaning more on the favorable side) mindset. First thing I noticed was the decor. It really is a snazzy looking place. If I were to imagine what Paris Hilton's bedroom looked like, it would be this, minus all the tables and booths. We were seated inside but the outside patio looked to be just as swanky, dimly lit and perfect for a romantic dinner outside.So, the waiter comes to the table, ""can I get something for you?"". We order our drinks, 10 minutes later, our drinks come out. Then, ""what would you like?"", we all order. 15 minutes later our individual appetizers come out. My husband got some sort of meat concoction with onion marmalade. He ate most of it, I could barely stand to look at it.  In fact, the gentleman who brought this over gave everyone else their plates, a rundown of what they were having and when he pointed to my husband he said ""And you're having.....that...."" and walked away. Umm...??? I ordered the dirty rice stuffed quail, it was tasty but the quail was a little dry and it had some sort of relish on top that I removed and put to the side. Next course came about 20 minutes after our last plate was taken, it was bacon wrapped pork tenderloin over cheesy grits. The grits were phenomenal, in fact, I probably would have preferred just that. The pork tenderloin left something to be desired. Dessert arrived about 20 minutes after the last plate was picked up, this was my favorite dish. Aside from the weird slab of caramel on the edge of the plate, everything just fit together, the others all had something off about them. It was 3 perfect little lemon tarts. Really this was very good.Then the incredibly friendly waiter comes over, takes our plates, leaves the bill on the table. He comes back a few minutes later, takes it, charges us and leaves it back on the table. No ""thank you"", no ""how was your meal"", no nothing. What did their appearance in ARW do for me? Taught me to not go back, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't what I had hoped and the waiter definitely didn't help their cause.",3.0 star rating
"Hosted my wifes birthday in the private party room at TRACE this past December in the middle of the holiday season when its competitive to get a place and difficult to get top notch service.  Not only was the event coordinator, Scott, super accommodating with my planning, but he was also amazing at  his responsiveness and ability to help plan this special event with me so it would go off without a hitch!With the help of Scott I put together a 5 course meal with options per course for guests to choose from.  We included a vegan/gluten-free option for both adults and children.  The menu's included personalized greetings for my wife celebrating her birthday and every aspect of the pre-planning with Scott played out smoothly the night of the event.Each course of the meals were well received by the 20 guests in attendance.  The favorites from each course were:Soup - Both the Gumbo and the Sweet Potato Bisque (seasonal) received positive reception from our guestsSalad - Roasted Beet Salad (I don't like beets but in this salad they were great)App - Braised Beef Short Ribs (could have had two orders of this and called it a night they were so good)Entree - The Niman's steak was good (not best steak in town) but the Chicken breast on crispy sweet potatoe waffle fries (their version of chicken and waffles) was a hit with everyone that ordered itDessert - Kids had donut holes with three choices of sauce to dip and the favorite for adults was the chocolate cream pie.  The service was great.  When the event started and as guests were arriving, the ambiance was a bit too 'romantic' for our group and we asked that they lighten the room a bit.  They did so with no objections even though it required them to also lighten the main area slightly too.  The staff guided our guests to our table and promptly assisted with coats and first drinks for everyone.  Their attention to the children was much more than I expected given we were at the ""W"".  I had one guest that presented challenges to the staff and they did such a good job with my guest that I wasn't aware of the issue until the next day when friends and family at the table told me what happened.Overall, the support in planning was fantastic, the service was excellent the night of the event and the food was great.  The cost to host the event (which included both selected wines and an open tab for guests) was surprisingly less than I expected.  I would definitely host another dinner event at TRACE in the future.",4.0 star rating
"Trace is my favorite place in Austin to get brunch.  The food is great; the atmosphere is awesome and they have great drinks.  But, probably the best part is the customer service.   We have had Gene as our waiter a few times now and he is always happy to go the extra mile, which made this review worth writing.  This is definitely the place to go if you want to be pampered and enjoy a beautiful Austin day.  It's fun to hit the W pool afterwards for cocktails on a beautiful day (as me and my friends did).  The service was pretty great there as well.  Basically a perfect day!",5.0 star rating
"I dig a place that lets me do what I want when I want. I toured the hotel with the second street sidecar in my hand. The girl who was giving me the tour asked if I'd like another and that we could have it brought up. I was impressed. I wanted to eat in the library lounge once and the waiter brought my food and drinks to me after that. Pros: that service is impeccable, the manager came and said hello and asked if everything was great. He came and stood with us outside during our smoke break and we conversed. Personable, I like it. The cucumber jalapeño is cool and crisp. Second street sidecar is awesome and they brought me three on my birthday. :D Cons: some of the barstaff acts like there's a stick up there ass, I can't get a drink on weekend evenings because everyones prettier than me.

"We visited Trace on a weekday night before an ACL show and had booked our reservations before reading other reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately I'll have to agree that Trace is less than stellar, despite its obvious aspirations at being a fine dining restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the food is good and nicely prepared but it's bland and tasteless. I had the grilled octopus starter. You would expect something described as ""grilled"" to have an element of smoky flavor and a bit of crispness around the edges, but it didn't. The most flavorful thing about the dish were the herb sprigs used as a garnish. My wife's duck confit salad consisted of some pieces of duck in the bottom of a bowl (?), covered with overdressed greens. I won't say anything about the entrees except that they were pretty much in the same style.The kitchen did provide one nice touch, however. After asking our server about the charcuterie appetizer we ultimately decided on our choices described above. The chef was nice enough to send out a sampling of the house made pate and sausages for us to try. They turned out to be the best thing we had all night, with good flavor and texture. We both wished we had ordered the charcuterie platter instead of the other starters.Would we go back? Probably not. There are several other places within walking distance of ACL that can deliver much more value for the dollar.",2.0 star rating
"So I had a chance to drop by Trace during my Carnaval weekend staycation. Trace is one of those restaurants that is very trendy and somewhere to be seen. I'd probably dress up a bit to go here as most of the crowd is very W oriented.Atmosphere: I love the decor at Trace. The tables are well spaced, there's great ambient lighting, AND there's a gorgeous outdoor patio area that has trees with lights in them. Sidenote: My napkin looked like a blind seamstress with no hands had hemmed it and then a badger destroyed it. It was literally falling apart and the hem was crooked as a drunk man's strut. Suffice to say the napkin should have never made it's way to the table had any quality control been exercised. I noticed this immediately and just grabbed one from another table. When the waiter stopped by he noticed the crumpled napkin on the corner of the table and inquired what had happened. I just told him the napkin was pretty messed up. Once he saw it himself he was horribly embarrassed as the restaurant should have been.  It's not a deal breaker, but it shows a lack of attention to detail and quality control. Other than that the restaurant is gorgeous and I'd definitely recommend it for a date night.Service: The waiter was great. He was attentive and frequently checked up on us without hovering. In addition when I had to send my entree back he was very polite and understanding. No complaints here!Food: Now besides the napkin situation this is where Trace loses it's 2 stars. I dined here with two other friends. To start we got the Pan Roasted Crab Cakes, Blue Crab Hush Puppies, Anson Mills Cheese Grits, Fries, Smashed Salt Potatoes, and we ordered the Lamb Sweetbread Terrine and La Quercia Coppa Americana from the Charcuterie menu. I also ordered the Vegetable Soup and my friend had the Garden Salad. For our entrees my guy friend ordered the Pecan Crusted Red Grouper, and my girlfriend and I both went with the Niman Ranch Cowboy Ribeye which came with truffled mac & cheese on the side. So we ordered a lot. Now I'll break down the bad first:The Crab cakes: There was a very sweet tomatillo jam on the side that really detracted from the overall taste. Also the crab cakes themselves were very sweet and very ""crabby"". As in there was no breading, it was literally entirely crab. Now this normally isn't something to complain about, but in this case all the crab meat was so sweet that a nice salty breading would have done wonders.The Mac and Cheese: As soon as the waiter set those dishes down I knew something was wrong. The smell they gave off was super pungent and overwhelming. It smelled like someone had a far too heavy hand with parmesan cheese and truffle oil. When I tried it, it tasted exactly like it smelled, cloying and overwhelming. The decent:The Cheese grits, Fries, Charcuterie items, and Hush Puppies were all exactly what you expected them to taste like and that was fine. They were good. Was I blown away? No, but they lived up to my expectations. The great:The Ribeye: This was a great cut of beef, however I have a disclaimer. I ordered my steak Medium-rare to medium (as in slightly more than Medium Rare). When my first steak came out, it was completely well done. I had to send it back. My second steak came out perfect (I ordered just a straight medium-rare this time). The steak was flavorful and came with a red wine reduction for dipping. However it was a 24 oz bone-in ribeye so be prepared, it's pretty substantial. On a positive note, the restaurant brought out another bowl of the vegetable soup and smashed salt potatoes on the house because my steak was cooked incorrectly. My dessert was complimentary as well. The Smashed Salt Potatoes: These were amazing! From the awesome pan frying of the potatoes to the delicious caramelized onions on the bottom. This was the best side dish on the entire menu. The Grouper: My guy friend said he liked it a lot, and he finished it all. I didn't sample any but since he ate it all, I'm assuming it was decent at least so we'll call it ""great"". The Vegetable Soup: I loved this soup. It was flavorful, but still light. It wasn't heavily salted and there was an abundance of fresh vegetables in it. I completely recommend it!After this we ordered desserts all of which were amazing. We had an aversion to anything ""alcohol"" tasting because of the partying the night prior so we did make some substitutions. I don't remember the dessert names off the top of my head and their website still has the fall menu up so I can't exactly go into detail. I will say that they are all very good so I doubt you can really go wrong.Overall I'd say it's a trendy place to go. Come here to be seen, but the price point, napkin oversight, and the fact that the mac and cheese was actually kind of stomach turning makes me knock off points. This is supposed to be a fairly upscale restaurant so the missteps do count against them.",3.0 star rating
"Great ambiance/ great bar scene/ great presentation... lackluster food.  The cheese selection was small but unique and satisfying.  They have a lovely cow's milk cheese rubbed in coffee which was yummy and the sheep's milk was great too- they serve the cheese with grilled bread, which is great for soft/triple cream cheeses... but these were hard cheeses and needed crackers.  They were served with the wrong accouterments.  The fish and fish special were beautifully presented, cost nearly $30, and were almost disappointing.  The okra stew and grits on the redfish were hardly warm and the overall flavor was missing a key ingredient... even salt would have made it better.  The grouper special was beautiful but suffered from the same disease.The drunken donuts are fun and make for a nice desert, but I can't imagine myself coming back to this place for a desert which will only make me hate myself more (5 or so LARGE donuts with chocolates sauces and whipped cream made with liquors).I do want to come back and hang out at the bar and would consider appetizers, but will not choose to dine in the restaurant again.I do see that there are wonderful reviews on the service, and our waitress was lovely, but she was slow and must have had too many tables.  I did place in our reservation notes that we were celebrating a birthday and I had to remind them of this... so didn't get my outstanding service award... especially since it was spelled out.  At least I'm not torn on trying other restaurants!",2.0 star rating
"I'm pretty disappointed. I've been to Barchi dozens of times, but it's gone downhill and this time will be my last. I took my team here for a work lunch. Half the food wasn't seasoned at all (shishitos and bento vegetables). The pork and salmon were overcooked. The nigiri was bland and dry. It just seemed like no effort was put into our food.

"The quality of the sushi here is actually pretty good. The yellow tail was delicious and was comparable to a lot of top sushi restaurants on the west coast.The reason for my low rating is the service.....-It was my friend's birthday last night and we set up a reservation for 10:45 pm. When we arrived for the reservation they told us they were getting our table ready. We ended up with a party of 8 waiting for 45 MINUTES. It got to the point where we ended up ordering from the bar and the bartender kept combining everyone's orders into one check when there were multiple orders as we explicitly asked that the charges be separate. Furthermore, she forgot to place a couple dishes on the order as well.After the 45 minute wait and all the headache, the restaurant did nothing to compensate the long wait or the poor service.",2.0 star rating

"So there's not too many HHs I've met that I didn't like, and BarChi is no exception. From 3-7 M-F you can ply yourself with an assortment of $4 Martinis, house wine (red/white), domestic and imported beers between $2.25-$4, $1.50 sake bombs, $4 Hot Sake and $7 home made fruit flavored sakes. If all that affordable alcoholic goodness is not enough for you they have an assortment of $1.50 sushi pieces; Maki rolls between $4-$4.50 and ample tasty Appetizers that include potstickers, sweet potato fries, short ribs, tempura, edamame between $3-$4.50. And the cat's meow - $1.50 bacon wrapped scallops (2 on a skewer). I met a dozen ore more of my closest yelp women friends here for Keri B.'s monthly W3ND (Women Who Wine N Drink). Mike, our server was both attentive and hot. We did split a dessert - Tempura fried ice cream... It was fantastic - but enough for a small team of athletes to share. Even the desserts were in the $4.50 range. The food was tasty. The scallops divine. The HH wine selection could have been better (Copper Ridge). But for $4 it is hard to complain.

"It was a nice saturday. We were curving sushi in downtown. Well, i found this place and we tried it. I think they need to improve their sushi quality. I am not sayong they are not good, but they are not the best. The waiter were nice and friendly. We sat outside because we brought our dog. So yes you can bring your dogs and eat outside when the weather is nice.Anyway, we didnt get the best salmon frombthem, probably it was happy hour time? I love sushi, and i know that i can tell if they use fresh tuna/salmon. I wish they were.Their price were ok. Well, itnwas happy hour so half pruce basucally. We ordered 4 different entrees and we spent $36. So it was not that bad.Am i going there again? Probably yes but only if i have to.Do i recommend it to people?

"For my birthday dinner we made reservations here for 7. They were very accomodating since our # kept changing and then to top it off we were running late. And then to make the evening even better (it was already good since helloooo it was my brithday) but I found a free parking spot right around the corner from BarChi. Unfortunately I cannot parallel park so I made my baby bro get out of park my car for me. Their drink menu had many interesting cocktails that we decided would be interesting to try. I first tried the raspberrytini and it was like heaven in my mouth. Next up was the candy appletini. Good, tasty, strong drinks. My brother had the mangotini and that was even stronger than mine. Pineapple mojito? Holy cow, amazing. Whatever you do, don't get the Napoleon Dynamite because it tasted like sudafed. As you can see the juices were flowing all before dinner. For our starters we ordered some calamari, served with some amazing, different marinara sauce. I wasn't even sure if it was marinara because it was a bit spicy and just beyond delish. I then tried some grilled oysters for the first time. Okay I might have been forced into this, and was disappointed to find out that they aren't as horrible as I thought they would be. In fact, I actually liked them. They were topped with cheese and parmasean, wowee such interesting flavors together!For dinner we tried to keep it light and ordered a buffet of rolls. My cousin & I shared the caterpillar and the chi rolls, which both came with 8 each and were pleasantly huge! Tried some other rolls too but can't remember the names. They were all AMAZING. My brother got some noodles that were the thickest noodles I've ever seen, and even that was pretty good, he couldn't even finish it all. They even had a DJ. For $150, 8 people drank/ate and celebrated the awesomeness of me. And then an amazingly generous, sneaky person snuck in $100 for our bill when I went to the bathroom. Sneaky sneaky!Once we left here, the rest of the evening got kinda blurry....",5.0 star rating
"The only reason to check this place out is the Happy Hour. Sushi is pretty cheap and pretty tasty. I really like the lychee saki, but it's not worth the price (even with the HH discount). There's definitely way better sushi in town, but not at these prices.",3.0 star rating
"If you're in the mood for sushi, you could do better.  The memory of that abused caterpillar roll drowning in a sloppy swamp of eel sauce, falling apart at the slightest touch of my chopsticks will forever haunt me.  It was so sweet it bordered on inedible, and the fact that it crumbled on my plate and turned into a soup made eating it a physical challenge.  I can hold my own with a pair of chopsticks, but I'm no miracle worker.I also got a California roll, and it wasn't rolled worth a damn, either.  It tasted like a California roll, I guess, because I don't remember it being particularly good or bad.  One thing I do remember, though, is the awful Miami Vice 80's decor they had going on in this place.  Bleck.",1.0 star rating
"This is probably more on the 3.5 side, but not the 4 star side.  Anyone who knows me knows I'm no sushi pro and that I eat it with my fingers 90% of the time because of poor chopstick skills. But I actually love raw fish and am all over that. I was not impressed with the texture of the fish, meh. I tried a couple of the rolls and wasn't super jazzed by that either.  This place serves a ton of different things though, which in theory is nice if you're with a crew who isn't sushi-proficient, but it wasn't super jazzy either. While I thought the lettuce wraps were super delish, the chicken fried rice was nothing excited. I ordered the filet mignon and while the meat was okay, I was impressed with the twist on the potatoes (Wasabi Mashed Potatoes pack a punch!)I will say the ambiance here was the real hit. I liked the look, trendy but relaxed at the same time. These guys are pretty accommodating with a group as well and this is within walking distance of other fun stuff. I expected better, and in Austin (my food binge city, of all places!)",3.0 star rating
"Came here on a Saturday, and be warned, they have a DJ that BLARES terrible house music. It was painfully and uncomfortably loud and kind of killed the rest of our night. I thought that trend died out years ago, but unfortunately not. They do offer reverse happy hour at this time though, which was kind of cool. We were able to sample a few things. My favorite was the grilled octopus. The sushi was mediocre. Not great, not terrible. The rice was clumpy and hard, obviously old. Nothing really spectacular about this place, other than the fact they stay open much later than any other sushi spot. So if you're having a midnight sushi craving and you have earplugs (I'm not that old, I promise), try it out. That's about the only reason I would come back. Our server was great, so kudos to him!",3.0 star rating
"This review is tough.  We tried several rolls here and things like cheap drinks and location were really the only thing exciting.  The rolls and happy hour selection were disappointing.  Ohhhh and the owner staring at us for the entire hour of our dining.  He passed our table about 20 times, never stopped to ask how the food was, or to see if he could refill our water, just a very slow pace and an awkward stare.We ordered the Spicy Girl and Volcano roll from the regular menu, the volcano roll was covered with rubbery craw fish, and way too much tempura.  The Spicy Girl was great, however not worth $12.The happy hour menu was boring so we ordered the Austin Roll and the Spicy Tuna roll, nothing special here.  I could see myself going back to grab one of these $5 rolls for lunch but that's about it.The pineapple infused sake was pretty amazing... major points here!I hate when restaurants charge $1 extra for soy paper, so this was a turn off  especially when the waiter asked us if we would like soy paper for 50cents. Overall I think BarChi has a ton of of potential, I will go back and see if over time they get better.  I haven't marked them off the list yet.",3.0 star rating
I had such a good experience here for dinner. There are so many choices I have to return to try the ones I thought sounded best. The edemame was really good and I absolutely love the atmosphere. It was dark and secluded with chill music playing.,5.0 star rating
"We went for the all day Sunday happy hour. The happy hour menu is cheap, but not super exciting. They have nigiri for $1.50 a piece; the albacore is the best of the bunch, although the fish is cut extremely thin. Salmon, tuna, and tamago were okay. We also ordered the Austin Roll (tuna, shrimp, escoloar) and the Shrimp and Avocado Roll. I didn't like the texture of the shrimp in the Shrimp and Avocado Roll, but the Austin Roll was not too bad. From the appetizers menu, we ordered the oyster shooter, calamari, and gyoza. The gyoza was the tastiest of the bunch. The calamari was mostly batter and oil. Do NOT order the oyster shooter. Overall, not a bad place to get some basic sushi offerings for cheap. I wouldn't pay full price for any of the items we got, but it's definitely worth checking out during happy hour.",3.0 star rating
"I give the food an absolute 10. I give the service a 1. I literally am sitting here right now trying to finish my food and the manager comes up to me saying... ""I have a table of 10 keep asking me about your table. What do I do?"" Like are you kidding me??? It took us an hour and a half to get 5 rolls of sushi. How dare you come up to us and basically tell us that when we are still waiting on our food. So unprofessional. So excuse me while I shove my food down my throat so people with higher priority than me can actually sit down and enjoy their food.Although our waitress Paulina was awesome.",1.0 star rating

"I came here for the first time last night for reverse happy hour. It was definitely a nightlife kind of place. They have their own DJ, loud music, dim lights, and dark modern decor. You can sit at the bar or tables up front, and there are booths and more lounge-type areas in the back. FOOD: Their dumplings and sushi were pretty standard. The sushi wasn't beautifully prepared, but who notices after a few lychee martinis? The nigiri was surprisingly fresh, however. The super white tuna (escolar) and salmon nigiri are my favorite! Their Austin roll (it showed up as some other name on the bill) is a combination of fish roe, salmon, tuna, tomago, and avocado. Not one of their best special rolls; I'll have to try their others later.SERVICE: Extremely nice server! My boyfriend and I showed up late to join 4 other friends, but she was very accommodating. She forgot extra chopsticks, but other than that, she tried her best to keep our table happy. We stayed until closing time because of the fuss over the bill, but she was very patient with us. She was even ready to leave before us, but she held the door and wished us a good night! The food is nothing to rave about, but I think it's an awesome place to get drinks, sushi, and hang out with friends. I'm pretty excited to try this place out again sometime soon.",4.0 star rating
"Bar Chi is, well, phenomenal. They have a fantastic happy hour and also all day happy hour on Sundays.We could not pass up the $1.50 sake bombs, $2.25 bud light / coors light / miller lite bottles, or $4 wine or martinis. They also have a pretty extensive happy hour food menu of all kinds of sushi, rolls, and skewers (chicken, beef, etc.)  The prices range anywhere from $2-$4. You can drink for cheap and fill the belly and leave happy! The sushi is perfect.  They make the rolls the right size - not huge so you feel like you have to cut it in half. They are smaller, bit size - the way sushi is meant to be. They also bring it out on a wood plank which I really liked. The atmosphere is low key and they have indoor and outdoor seating.  They have also been known to have a dj later at nights on the weekends that plays a little bit of dubstep if you dig. The service was a little slower than I'd like, but our server seemed new, so I gave her a break. I will definitely be back.  Props to our bartender Megan! :)",4.0 star rating

"Yayyyy sushi happy hour daily, reverse happy hour Friday and Saturday, and all day Sundays -- can't be beat!!!  This is by far one of my fav sushi restaurants downtown.  Happy hour prices are totally reasonable for good quality food and good sized portions, with a GREAT selection to choose from.  Shrimp and avocado roll, chi roll, and sweet potato fries are all worth ordering.  The watermelon martini is also super delish especially in a hot day in Austin ( which can be almost any day!).  Ordinary menu prices are more expensive (obviously) but the happy hour specials are a good deal.I have always had good service and the ambiance inside is cool and trendy, with lower lighting and modern decor.  Definitely recommend!",4.0 star rating

Don't think I'd do that at dinner time though, out of respect for the place.",5.0 star rating
"Wonderful little authentic Italian restaurant on 2nd Street.  Hidden next to several other top-notch restaurants, it's easy to overlook this one or walk by unnoticed, however you will be pleasantly surprised by the food and ambiance here.  I started with their red cabbage soup, which was a delicious blended soup (actually purple) that was hearty and a great starter.  Then of course, I had to try the National pizza of Italy, the margherita pizza.  It was simple and perfect!  The owners and managers and it appears much of the staff are Italian.  It's worth eating here just to listen to them talking back and forth, occasionally arguing, in Italian.  The manger, Marco, is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and history of some of their dishes.They have Peroni on draft, also their own Sparkling water on tap, which they will place a large bottle on your table for a nominal charge.  I didn't try it, but they also have Gelato and espresso coffee available too.  Will be back again the next time I'm in the area.",4.0 star rating

And it was $15 for one piece of bad lasagna, no sides included. At my table there was a 15 minute gap (no exaggeration) between when the first entree was brought out to the table and the last, even though they were all pasta dishes that shouldn't have taken that long.

"From the Vespa mural on the back wall, to the hanging assortment of random cookware and meats, this no frills, charming eatery enthusiastically points out, ""Hey, we're Italian!""  And while appearances are often deceiving, the Italian-kitsch accurately reflects the simple, yummy, and undeniably Italian fare.  The caponata con crostini, is a delicious spreadable mix of eggplant, tomatoes, onions and olives.  Were it available in take-home jars, my cellar would be stocked and I would be praying for a natural disaster. The caeser salad was very anchovy-tasting, which I love, but still seemed to be missing something.  It tasted a little too light. For our main, we ordered the diavolo/pepperoni pizza.  'Twas divine: great crust + tasty toppings w/o overburdening us with cheese.  I am a huge fan of that pie.  And considering the very reasonable price for such a tasty treat, this may be a new staple for me.  Dessert was a little disappointing, we ordered the chocolate torte which was less torte-y and more like eating a cold bar of chocolate, but honestly, not a big deal considering how delicious the pizza and the caponata were. Service was excellent: fast and friendly. :)",4.0 star rating

"Uchi Austin was wonderfully delicious, but unfortunately the entire dining experience was ruined by the EXTREMELY slow pacing of our dishes. It started out great, but by the time we were all done, all of us were still so hungry somehow. Came here on a Sunday evening with my best friends and we were a group of 6 people. By the way, I recommend not coming in on Sundays. Apparently, they don't receive any deliveries since it's a Sunday. I was so upset they ran out of sea urchin and their hot rock wagyu beef and ponzu.We decided to try their Omakase ""chef's tasting"" (mkt price), which is the 10 course. We thus were given these dishes:1. hirame usuzukuri (thinly-sliced flounder, candied quinoa, olive oil) - Love the candied quinoa on this one! Sort of tasted like micro sugar cubes combined with the flounder.2. chelsea gem oyster (leche de tigre) from South Puget Sound - These oysters were exquisite! My first time trying Chelsea Gem Oysters. A must get if you love raw oysters! Not so sweet, and meats were silky.3. hama chili yellowtail, ponzu, thai chili, orange supreme - Nothing special, would skip this one.4. kinoko usuzukuri (trumpet mushroom, shallot, cypress) - SO GOOD. Surprised it was a mushroom. But would skip. Let's be real... We come to Uchi for da fish!5. iwana (smoked char) - This one was SO GOOD and by far MY FAVORITE. It tasted like smoked salmon but BETTER. On a different level. A must try if it is on the menu!6. tako (octopus) - Deliciously cooked octopus, although not one of my favorites. I'm not a big fan of octopus to begin with though.7. tarabagani no bito (king crab, beet, strawberry, nori) - Slightly sour and sweet. This dish was refreshing to eat. But would skip this one if I had to.8. saba shio (mackerel, cucumber, zaba zu) - Pleasant, but I would also skip this one.9. akami te (bigeye tuna, nam pla, strawberry) - This one was alright. A bit citrusy and sweet, and in my opinion similar to the tarabagani no bito.10. foie gras (duck liver) - Always have been a favorite of mine at the Dallas and Houston locations. Wish they served it a little warmer here, but that is okay.Also ordered:gyutoro yaki (72-hour short rib, lemon, onion) - DELICIOUS. Also recommend ordering this one.Desserts:1. oishi foie (foie gras ice cream, sourdough, cherry) - My favorite dessert hands down. The foie gras was subtle to me and blended in perfectly with the ice cream. Tasted a bit like chocolate.2. ichigo okashi (japanese cheesecake, strawberry, cocoa nib) - Second favorite dessert! The Japanese cheesecake was moist, soft and therefore very delightful. A favorite by many.3. peanut butter semifreddo (apple-miso, golden raisin) - Would skip if you're not into peanut butter. This one tastes like a peanut butter apple pie.Now that I've been to all 3 Uchi locations, I would say that Austin had a bit more variety on the menu, however the Dallas location isn't too far behind and provides much better service consistently (I've been there numerous times!), therefore making the experience fantastic overall.",4.0 star rating
"A few days ago was my first time at Uchi. My girlfriend and I went at 5:30 PM on a Monday, during their Sake Social/Happy Hour. There was barely any normal parking, so we used the ""complimentary valet"" after looking for parking nearby. There seemed to be a sign that said more parking nearby, but that block's lots has lots of towing signs. Once inside, we were seated right away despite the restaurant being nearly full. We ordered one of every food dish on the happy hour menu except for the foie, as well as Edamame and Gyumaki (grilled wagyu). Overall, there was some good flavor, but also a handful of not very flavorful dishes. I suppose I would've liked the sushi a little more fishy. The complementing between the food and side sauces were also hit (great) or miss (fine, but not what one would expect from this place). For comparison, Uchiko was mostly hits, and Uchi was 50/50. The Jidori Tom Kha was excellent. I also liked the harumaki with its sauce. The Gyumaki was disappointing, the grilling of the wagyu takes away some of the tenderness. The edamame was one of the last dishes to come out, which was surprising; we like to eat edamame first or as other dishes come out, not last. We ordered the Chocolate Ganache desert after all of the other food had come out-- it came quickly and was great.The service was great, the waiter checked on us multiple times, and gave us updates on what dishes were left to come out once we were about two-thirds through our order. The atmosphere was lively but not loud. The restaurant was quite dark, and while I could read the menu, multiple other patrons had to use their phones to see the menu text. At the end of the meal, our attentive server brought the bill, but went to reprint it when he took my gift card (covered one quarter of the bill, I tipped on the full amount). As far as servers go, we liked him and his stream of co-workers bringing out each dish and telling us what it was.We ended up being quite happy with the food and experience-- it was good, but it wasn't amazing. I must note that this restaurant is very expensive (as the four dollar signs indicates), so I went in to try out the place and did not expect to fill up. Based on the about eleven dishes we got, and my girlfriend not liking a few, I left satiated for a few hours.",4.0 star rating
"For the third time we had John as our server on our wedding anniversary.  This has become a bit of a habit for us.  However, before the good part let me share a bit of disappointment. We made our reservations months in advance as always.  Got sat at a two person table at the front of the restaurant near the host stand.  Then we proceeded to wait for 20 minutes before our waiter came by and say hello.  Then he had a tray of water and said he be right back and he finished with his other table.  The other table was a six person table.  Ughhh it is June and very hot can I get some water?  After another 10 minutes go by.  I got up and asked the hostess if we could move tables.  I mean it is our anniversary and we come here every year.  This isn't going to cut it when we plan to spend over $400.  They were very nice. Extremely professional. Thankfully, they put us in a booth in the back of the restaurant and we were very pleased to have John as our waiter.From this point forward everything was back to Uchi standards.  We usually tell John how hungry we are and what we usually like.  We also let him know of my nut allergy.  He goes from there.  He is extremely professional and everything he brings us is the best quality and so tasty.  Some of our favorites on this trip were the Hot Rock and the Ribeye Nigri with a Quail Egg.  We have had the Hot Rock before but the Nigri was a great treat.They gave us a nice desert to celebrate our anniversary.This review is as much for the food as for John.  He is the best.  Above and beyond.  Been here since they opened.  Great server.Total price for two people plus a bottle of wine was $340 without tip.  Worth every penny.",5.0 star rating

"TLDR: You've heard of this place. Your hype man/woman has been telling you that this is the alpha & omega of sushi restaurants. You're being told that even if the omakase straight up had the chef's dong wrapped in rice and presented on a wood board, it doesn't matter, you better get it....The truth is...it's just ok.Everyone Elks: I've heard of this place from many many people. Probably the only restaurant anyone mentions besides Franklin's BBQ whenever you tell people you're going to Austin. Understandably, my dearest wife and myself made a reservation for the evening and before I go any further, let me just explain something...I am a hype man. Dude, no joke, I'll hype up a dog turd that's been cooking away on the sidewalk in the summer sun. The difference between when I do it and anyone else does it (including you) is that I actually know what I'm talking about. If you don't agree with me, you have bad taste. To make a long story short, this place is overhyped. That's not a good thing, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.Parking: Parking is actually quite chill. You have the option to either self-park, or use the complimentary valet service.Service: Service is ok. They kind of took a long time in between our dishes. Nothing better or worse than what you would get at Outback Steakhouse....so dank. Bloomin' onion FTW. That sauce tho. Le Ambience: It's nice in there. Some might even say it's cumbersome. I'm not quite sure what ""cumbersome"" means though cause I'm a dude and dudes don't say that. There's seating for a ton a people and the have a decent sized sushi bar. We were sat at a table like commoners. It's not the nicest restaurant I've ever been too but I suppose it's good enough. It reminds me of what P.F. Changs would be like if it were smaller and Japanese in theme. Food: Besides being out of most things, I'll go over the highlights from the meal.Good~~Walu Walu - Oh my....if I ever go back to UCHI imma just order two orders of this. Cooked white fish with perfect sear and a light citrus sauce. God Damn.Hamachi - Best I've ever had.Sake(Salmon) - Fattiest I've ever had...couldn't really taste it because it just melted. It may be too high quality....as awkward as that sounds.Eel - Good as hell. Light char taste. Close to perfect.Tofu surprise (I forgot the name) - Very Very Good. Tastes pretty similar to the Walu Walu dressing.Bad~~Fish from Tsukiji - KnifeJaw and AmberJack are pretty whatever. It's melt in your mouth and all but nothing that will have you screaming ""Holy Moly!""***The Flounder Fin sucks. It was literally awful...they brought it to us by accident, and I'm just having a hard time thinking about somebody willingly ordering this...that person must suck. It's slimy and and herby...it reminds me of eating a gordons fish filet that was frozen, and put in the over for like 45 seconds to let it thaw out. Just awful.***Kohada(Shad) sucked too. And waddayaknow! it came with the flounder fin! The person who ordered it must really suck.Shag Roll - Tempura is great and it's fried to perfection but that's about all. It lacks flavor outside of the tempura.Price:Look, maybe I'm a basic ass broke ass bitch ass bitch, but I find it hard to pay $190 per person for omakase. Am I reaaaallllllly going to remember the art of the dish or the flavor 2 months from now?Realistically, no. When I go to a sushi restaurant, I know what I like, and can be adventurous on my own outside of the basics like salmon, eel, and yellowtail. Think about your wallet and your memory for food when choosing between ala cart and omakase. Or don't. Be cool and spend all your money. I don't care.Final Thought:Would I ever come back here? No. I would much rather go to Kuneho. Similar prices, nicer place, and in general, tastier dishes. Unfortunately, I feel like uchi is more trendy than delicious, and overall just ok.",3.0 star rating

Recommend making a reservation, they can get really crowded even on weekdays and it's a pretty small restaurant. Best sushimi and sushi I've ever had- the fish is extremely fresh. The chefs have a way of combining some of the most unique flavors. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun, flavorful experience in a cool atmosphere.",5.0 star rating
"The omakase here is amazing... but make sure there are 2 of you. While traveling on business it is hard to taste everything in an omakase because they make it for 2. But with a large gut, I easily plowed my way through all the deliciousness I could.I wish I could have ordered more of the menu but alas no room.",5.0 star rating
"As you may have read on other reviews, happy hour (social hour) is 5-6:30 and you better get there early! I got there around 4:50 and was seated quickly once they opened! It was our first time there and the waitress explained everything well and was knowledgeable about the fish/menu. The happy hour menu is small and the portions on there are small but definitely tasty. My BF and I ordered pretty much 1 of everything on the happy hour menu to figure out our preferences. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the choices, but the machi cure was definitely a standout!We are sashimi lovers so we also ordered some sashimi as well (changes based on their shipments from Japan). There were some fish we hadn't heard of and the waitress helped us pick what we wanted. We got king fish and the john dory, both delicious! If you're curious, the kingfish has a stronger, buttery taste while the john dory is more light/delicate. The service here is amazing as well. They pace your food perfectly, and clear your dishes almost as quickly as you finish them. Our waitress even gave us some free sashimi and introduced us to a new fish! She rocks! All the hype is real! We're fans!",5.0 star rating
"So, Raw Fish in Central Texas huh?The English translation of Uchi is ""House""  and indeed, it's in a refurbished South Austin farm house.  It's a deceptively large space with tiny cramped tables creating an environment that is both loud and boisterous, but somehow it all works.  It's a Tyson Cole restaurant so it has a serious pedigree that does not disappoint.  Our waiter was great, steering us to best choices backed by an encyclopedic knowledge of fish, preparation style, beers and sakes all delivered at lightening speed.  An amazing talent to be sure.While clearly hybridized, the food offerings were amazing. I prefer the classic stuff and our waiter deftly steered us away from that gooey, mayo infused stuff that is popular now.  Delicate and beautifully presented it rivaled Nobu from the ""Olden"" NYC days.All in All, VERY Impressive.",5.0 star rating
Awesome experience! Our server Julie was just Wonderful! We asked her to pick the dishes for us based on our lines and dislikes and she did an awesome job! We liked all the dishes and she kept checking on us! I would say the only thing we wish was that we could have been seated at a booth rather than table. We were celebrating our Anniversary. And had made the reservations a lot in advance. They were really busy... Also Uchi Dallas spoils us with lots of amuse bouche thrown in ...Which we missed here. But 5 star experience!  Go Uchi! Thanks Uchi!,5.0 star rating
"Uchi = premier and creative sushi.The restaurant is open, and LOUD.  If you want a nice, intimate date night, this may not be the place.Chef Tyson created a fanciful menu for sushi-lovers, with items that will bring so much excitement to your taste buds. That said, I don't agree with certain items, such as the fois gras due to cruelty (there's a reason other states have banned it). So I consider myself grateful that the chef prepared a vegan menu with the most tantalizing dishes that leave you walking out feeling like you didn't miss out on a thing.  There are individual pieces to choose from, full rolls, appetizers, etc. Edamame - Fresh and unique! Not your typical edamame. Salted perfectly too!Kinoko - King Trumpet Mushroom (individual piece) so buttery... and yes, veganNasu - Japanese eggplant, lemon miso (individual piece)  - personal favoriteAvocado - (individual piece) over rice.  Sounds simple, but there's an Uchi twist! Spicy Crunchy roll - avocado, jalepeno, cucumber. Uchiviche - appetizer. Asian pear, tomato, bell pepper, garlic, cilantro... and more. Cool and refreshing! Seasonal Sorbet - Oh.My.Gosh. You'll get three small dishes of sorbet (mini scoops if you will). Some sweet, some tart. Yum.Aside from the noise level being a bit absurd, the only other drawback is Uchi's ""family style"" model and the wait between courses. There were good 15 minute periods in between dishes that had all been ordered simultaneously. That, and they seemed to think that the fish dishes would be shared with the vegans at the table. Stomachs were rumbling while waiting for meals to come out!Make a reservation a few weeks ahead of time as this place fills up FAST!",4.0 star rating
Love their social hour menu. Everything is so delicious and fresh. Their Walu Walu is so inventive  and tasty! We also tried their Wagyu Tartare Nigiri and our waiter suggested adding a quail egg w it. So yummy! Make sure you make a reservation or show up around 4:45 to be seated as a walk in.,5.0 star rating
"I'll start off on the positive notes for this place.1) The sushi here is better than anything you'll find in Austin as far as I know.2) The presentation of the food is spot on and exactly what you should expect from a high end restaurant.Now the negatives: 1) My girlfriend and I were absolutely disrespected. Many of the tables around us were receiving way more attention (perhaps because we are a younger couple?). I'm by no means exaggerating when I say our waiter came to check on us once every 40 minutes. This was very problematic because, like many other individuals, we were only ordering a few dishes at a time. Checking on a table once every 40 minutes is outright neglect no matter which way you look at it.2) Putting the poor service and long wait aside - the food simply isn't worth it. I don't mind dishing out more money for a great product, but the sushi didn't stand out as much as I had hoped. I feel like Kome is about as equally satisfying without getting your wallet milked.",1.0 star rating
"I've been to Alcomar quite a few times, and the service is consistently great!  From the hosts to the bartenders, we always experience friendly faces. The drinks also stand out!  I love the watermelon margarita, especially during happy hour.  If you like El Alma, you'll also love Alcomar!  Big plus, they were very sweet to my (quiet) baby.",4.0 star rating
"Questionable staff and the food lacks depth. I went twice, the chips are fresh and unique. The ""salsa"" lacks spice and has no heat or profile.  The steak was good however the sides were bland and flavor challenged. If you have young children do not go here.",1.0 star rating
"Alcomar is unique and delicious.  They do a spin on modern latin seafood and I can't think of anyone else in Austin quite like them.   the atmosphere is light and beachyHH is great, starts at 3 and you get a few bucks off some popular apps like the ceviche verde and many drinks.The sangria hits the spot. gulf oysters on the half shell. yum, the lobster enchiladas - decadent comfort food.  all the ceviches are worth checking out at HH, i especially like the ceviceh verde and scallop ceviche, lots of vinegar or maybe some type of acidity that i found pleasing.  speaking of scallops, the scallps veracruzan were cooked perfectly paired with grilled asparagus and a rich, perfect cauliflower flan.  i really like the pickled veggies and hot sauce they serve to every table. check out the patio, too!",5.0 star rating
"The food is absolutely delicious. However, it's definitely overpriced for what it is. Also not impressed with the service. It was slow and the servers are pretty inattentive. It was my sisters birthday which I had let them know about it when I made the reservation. The server made no mention of it and we had to remind her again so she would bring a dessert.",3.0 star rating
"Alcomar has a huge, kickass menu of excellent Latin-inspired seafood. Plus, giant 2d paintings of an octopus on the wall. For our dining party of 30+ (yes), their service once they got it rolling was outstanding. How the hell they managed to get all our orders, and then all of our food out in like, 20 minutes? Maybe? was some kind of magic, as Freddie Mercury says. Of course.. I did not have the seafood. ; ) I'm not allergic, in fact I really love fish, but there were many things on the menu that came with the fish dishes that I can't eat, and I did not want to rock the boat any more that I had to given our large party. So, I had the half roasted chicken with Xico mole, saffron rice, sweet plaintains, and corn tortillas. All were super. (If you google around for Xico mole, in particular, it makes it sound like it's going to be different from 'standard' mole, whatever you might define that is, but Alcomar's was amazing. Not too spicy, not too sweet. Maybe that's what I am mostly used to, style wise. If you want to fight about it at your dining table, here's a guide to a whole lot of different moles - luckypeach.com/the-guide…). There's limited but available outdoor seating. The restaurant interior is a nice open, airy cool space, great for Austin summers. A/c was legit, and not too cold (although I thought I heard somebody comment that condensation had leaked out of one of the vents, which is kind of an ambiance no-no).  As a number of other patrons have commented on Yelp though - the only thing detracted from the 5 star for me was the shitty design of the place for sound. Sorry Errol M - it wasn't just a tad loud, it was crazy stupid loud, even when the place was only 1/3 full. I had to yell at the person directly across from me.I dig you, Alcomar. But I'm going to say it...you are another restaurant in the universe that really did not consider how noisy your interior was going to be. Or, if you did, then, I strongly urge you to reconsider it, should you want to renovate in the future or build another location somewhere in our fine city. Gah. Maybe you thought someone like me would be so wowed by the food that I would just forget all about the yelling. I SAID, THE YELLING. HELLO? WHAT? MORE BEAUTIFUL MOLE AND CORN TORTILLAS PLEASE? RIGHT? Ok.",4.0 star rating
"Huge fan of this place. I come here all the time to enjoy their happy hour. Great margaritas- I love the variety they offer and find several of them delicious. They bring a little amuse bouche with some chips made in house, pickled veggies and this sauce that's super addictive. I almost always get their crab and guacamole and it's always delicious. I also love their mushroom gorditas. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them. They can be made vegan, too. Ugh, SO good. I also like their wine selection and often enjoy their Rosé by the glass. They do a nice job of offering a variety of food and drink that's a little different flavor than other places around. It's good for groups or for a date. It can get kinda loud when it's busy during peak hours, which it gives it a kinda casual vibe. And it's priced accordingly - this place does not break the bank. Oh! And they have brunch. You should go there, and eat that. They have some lobster brunch dish and other cool breakfast burrito-ish options. Very cool stuff! They also have a covered patio area. Again, it's not quiet as it's fairly close to S 1st St. But I've very much enjoyed myself every time I ate outside. This place has cool decor and is fun for people watching, too.",5.0 star rating
"What a great spot for happy hour!!! We shared half a dozen oysters and both got some fruity frozen margaritas. They do not water down the drinks here! The prices were great, the oysters were delicious, and the service was friendly and fast! I would love to come back for a full dinner on my next visit!",4.0 star rating
"Atmosphere is beautiful and drinks are fantastic but the food just leaves a little to be desired. The ceviche didn't have a great flavor balance, the guacamole wasn't really seasoned or fresh, and a few other appetizers were okay, but nothing that warranted the price tag they carried with them. It's a little bit of a shame, too, since I love to pony up with my man at the bar and enjoy their amazing selections of margaritas, but there needs to be at least a few small plates that are worth ordering to temper the effects of the tequila we're imbibing but unfortunately, we just didn't find enough on that front. If you're just stopping in for a drink, cool, but I would be weary trying to find enough dishes to enjoy an actual meal here.",3.0 star rating
"First experience here was good. I took my mother for Father's day. Second experience, I took my mother for Christmas Eve. The Jacked sangria had no whiskey. The ginger what have ya cocktail was absolutely bitters and sour. Lobster enchiladas had more flavor in the corn tortilla than anything in the entire dish. I think I made a better cream sauce in culinary school, i.e. cream and salt. Oh, and a Brunoise of lobster on top of a poorly seasoned enchilada, does not make Lobster Enchiladas.  Artichoke 'dip' was a mimick of the inside of a stretch Armstrong; and completely too spicy to eat. I'm all for a good happy hour, but please do not be fooled.",1.0 star rating
"Sadly, Alcomar didn't live up to our 4.5 star memory from a couple years ago. We walked in without a res and got bar seats. Great service and drinks from a dialed in bartender. First app was the flautitas. Very nice. Ate it all. Second app was the calamari but the kitchen has some issue so it came way late. We didn't care about the timing. The bartender comped it for being late. Cool. The batter was right on but the rings were over-cooked and chewy. Ate about half then quit. My wife had the red snapper which was great. She shared a few bites with me. Yum. She cleaned her plate. I had the Adobo grilled shrimp. One side of the shrimps were grilled, the other sides were raw. They were moderately undercooked and didn't taste very flavorful. That kind of ruined my buzz but I was too far into date night to send it back and start over. I picked at my plate and quit. We were happy to eat in our neighborhood but sad to spend $120 on a mediocre dinner.",3.0 star rating
"Very quiet and quaint, which is what I love about this place. There's no competition with you and the next table and you don't find yourself having to strain to hear what the person you're dining with is saying. The food is Mexican (or Tex Mex, I haven't learned to distinguish as yet) with a twist. They're very tasty and also very aesthetically appealing. VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY for sure. There are quite a few tasty vegetarian options, my favourite being the Mushroom Gorditas and the Cauliflower Flan (which was very creative). Definitely a great place for a relaxed date night. Their desserts are to die for btw !",5.0 star rating

"Had been wanting to check this place out and glad we did. I FUCKING LOVE seafood, which works out because that's about all they serve. Started with a dozen oysters and the mushroom tostadas app. Both were fantastic, but I might not recommend the shroom app (save room for more seafood!) The oysters were dank, served with an orange habanero sauce, really fresh really tasty. Would get again and again esp during happy hour!After this we got the mango Campechana (sp?) with shrimp, crab and scallop ceviche. Freaking good, and great to share. Also tried the cauliflower flan, which might have been one of the best parts of the meal (underdog app). I had two of the top shelf margaritas and the wifey had two of the frozen. We were both feeling pretty damn good, would recommend. For dessert we had the cheesecake empanada thing. It was tasty.Service was great, friendly and knowledgeable. Storm rolled thru as we were having our experience on the patio. Couldn't have been more perfect, a cool breeze on hot day with some rain and thunder followed by SUN. Pretty perfect.

"Went for Sunday brunch and guess what, we never even got anywhere close to trying anything to eat.First we were seated outside, per our preference, but it was too hot so we decided to move inside.The first place that we were seated was dirty, there was food lying on the table and the seating. Since the waiter had already left to get our drink orders we decided to seat ourselves at a different table.When the waiter brought our waters, there were lipstick stains on one of the glass and the other one had some residue from food. There was so disgusting that we decided to cancel orders and excuse ourselves.It's a shame because we were looking forward to trying this place for a long time and I don't think we will ever go back!",1.0 star rating
"It's sad that I have to give this place a 1 star review, especially because it looked like it had so much potential. We decided to try out Alcomar because the neighboring Bouldin Creek Cafe had a 45 min wait. After opting to sit inside, we were taken to a table and I immediately noticed that were dry as well as sticky food crumbs on the seating bench. I was hesitant to sit down and we were patiently waiting for our waiter to come back so I could show him the mess and also ask for a different seat. The waiters today seemed sluggish, so we found another table ourselves. Whatever, no biggie.After ordering our food, our waiter brought out our water glasses. My husbands glass had a huge red lipstick stain which grossed us out terribly. After we showed it our waiter and asked for another glass, I noticed my glass had some hardened food residues on it as well. That was the last straw and we decided to cancel our order because we wanted out of there. Sad thing is that I don't think the waiter seemed terribly bothered.Perhaps their food is good?

"It's weird, the business still has the same set up as the old El Chile, the tables, hostess counter, bar are all very similar, but it feels totally different inside. It was fresh and new. This has to be one of the prettiest restaurants in Austin. Pastels and a slightly nautical theme transport you to another city upon entrance. The food is great, but there was nothing I fell in love with. The Queso was served in a cast iron pan accompanied by Homemade Tortillas. I had the Waygu Steak Torta which was served with a delicious sauce. The bread was a bit too toasted, so it was crumbly and hard to eat. The steak was cooked perfectly, though. The service was okay, too, but we had a large, confusing group so I'll definitely give it a pass. I would try it. I really would, if for nothing else, just to be in a space that is so beautiful.",4.0 star rating

I've been going here for a year now and they recently changed up their breakfast taco selection and I'm very disappointed in the taste and quality.

On top of that they've raised the prices of their tacos so you're paying more for lower quality. Also the last two times that I've gone here my Iced Turbo tasted bad.

I'm not sure if this will make any sense but both my boyfriend and I thought they had the best toast! Not sure what or why that was but that's what we kept talking about after we left! lol Was it the butter ratio, the crusted toast of the bread...whatever it was it was delicious!

"Stumbled onto this place on the way somewhere else & was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered a vanilla latte & The Cubano; the latte was hot as was the spicy brown mustard on the pork sandwich. Toasted sweet bun was soft & delicious but slightly over-sized for the meat. My hubby had a tea (no sweet tea; scandal!) and a mushroom burger & fries. Now with this gem, the bun was perfection. The herbed dressing made this now standard menu item something to write about.

"One of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in my life. I used to be a marketing coordinator for a big restaurant in Dallas so I like to think I know the restaurant biz. When I think about my experience last night, I can't help but shutter. Myself, my boss and his wife waited 2 hours and 5 mins to get a table. We were quoted 1.5 -1.75 hours. We were passed over time and time again. I was given the excuse that they needed to ""balance reservations with walk ins"". I wasn't really sure where the balance came into play. A lady at the bar leaned over sympathetically  and asked how long we had been waiting. At the time it was 1 hr and 55 mins. My patience was wearing thin. I would have rather them told us they didn't take walk ins so we could have saved ourselves the trouble. To be perfectly honest, the food was not worth the wait. They were apologetic once we did get seated and offered us complimentary wagu as well as broccoli. While that was generous, it didn't make up for the poor hostess service. This place has nothing on Nobu. The only reason why I am even entertaining an additional star is because service after being seated was attentive and they did also give us a couple bites of random apps while waiting.

"I don't know where to begin... Oh my gosh the food and experience here was the best! We came on a Friday night without a reservation but didn't mind being seated at the sushi bar. We got seated within 5 min and our sushi chef was Yoshi. I would highly recommend sitting by him because he is very friendly and gave great recommendations. We started off with some miso soup and tempura shrimp. Cooked perfectly! I didn't even feel guilty for eating something fried! Followed by the uchinichi which was ""delicious as fuck"" as my boyfriend says. Next we had a variety of sushi, all very fresh and left me wanting more... And more I got! We got the Spider Roll with soft shell crab and a house made dipping sauce. I literally have no words to describe just how perfectly made the food was, they must have recipes blessed by the Gods! Then... Yes there's more! We had the Japanese style Nachos with fried yuca chips - a must try! Followed by dessert, we tried their special for the day and also received a complimentary dessert.

It was so loud in the restaurant and we were so happy to be there with two kids who were not yelling that we hadn't even noticed! We were embarrassed and felt like they were not happy our kids were there. We decided to leave. Another manager came over to drop off a dish and convinced us to stay, she was so kind and welcoming.

"Wasn't a huge fan of the restaurant. There's a nice interior and ambiance inside but I've had plenty of better sushi and at more reasonable prices. It is pricey so coming during happy hour can save you some money and allow you to order more variety. They have some interesting food fusions. We had a watermelon tuna which tasted refreshing but not something I would necessary go for again. We also ordered the hamchi kama but as I started eating it, I realized that the inside was still raw. Very disappointing, especially for such a high end and pricey restaurant. Our server took it back and we gave us another half of the hamachi kama which was nice but that experience ruined it for me. There is parking lot and valet but it fills up quickly for self-park as there's designated parking for other businesses nearby that share the lot.",2.0 star rating
"I figured I should review this place since the service is freaking impeccable and food is out of this world. I brought a party of 6 back in May. We had the 12 course tasting menu + a few apps. I'm not even going to go into what we had - seriously - the carpaccio dishes of fish and the mushroom one for my vegetarian friend were simply elegant, light, flavorful and the presentation amazing. My vegetarian friend had some special dishes made that satisfied her hunger and delighted her palate as well as pleased all of our eyes. Our courses were a mix of flavors and textures. The toasted quinoa on a few of the dishes was a nice complement to the richness of the flavor. One of the dishes mixed strawberries and tuna - amazing. Even though I couldn't touch the dessert (peanut butter gelato) it looked elegant and my fellow diners thought it was wonderful. We had a great quiet table behind the host stand. A couple of tips - tell them if you have dietary restrictions and they'll make your day. The wine choices are excellent and apparently so is the sparkling!Not to be missed and worth the $$$$.",5.0 star rating

"I was only in Austin for the weekend and really wanted to eat here. Based on the reviews, it was going to be amazing. Headed over without a reservation and was able to get on the waitlist with a 30 minute wait. We sat outside and ordered drinks and light apps while waiting for our table. Sake choices were amazing as were the grilled edamame.Once seated our server was extremely helpful in assisting us with choosing which plates to try.OMG. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was fabulous. This place is as good as, if not better, than Nobu.The hirame usuzurkuri was to die for...The Hama chili was SO good we ordered two!!...And the Salmon special was life changing....I would eat here every day if I lived in Austin.Absolutely Fantastic!",5.0 star rating
High quality food with efficient and attentive service. Some portions and quantities are on the small side but high quality and full flavored. The only disappointment was the pork ribs which was essentially all fat and no meat. A hopping busy place with nice ambiance. Would eat here regularly if I live in Austin.,4.0 star rating
"Wow, wow, wow. The sushi and cooked dishes are so good it's almost worth flying to Austin just for dinner. From start to finish each dish leaves you wanting more and it's a great place to spend with good friends. Standout dishes included (but not limited to), spicy grilled edamame, hamachi on thin plantain slices, chicken karage, steak cooked on hot rocks, and deep fried salmon sushi. Whether you're having dinner at the sushi bar or one of the comfortable tables, this restaurant won't disappoint.",5.0 star rating
If you are above 200lbs you cannot eat here because you will have to sell your house before feeling satisfied. However the food is dank AF. Some of the dishes I had I will review below.Bacon steakie: good combo of sweet and meat flavor. It is probably one of the more flavorful dishes offered here.Yokai berry: very refreshing. If you could taste the color white this would be itMachi cure: my gf says it was gud.Hama chili: PRI dankHamachi nabe: it was very soy saucey but I liked it.Karaage: its fried chikin in Asian sauce not much more to say. Brussel sprouts: I Dont like vegetables.. But this was good. It had many dankness to it. Alcohol:  always OK. I do think they have a BYOB with a $20 corkage fee.,4.0 star rating
"Finally!! In my 5th year in Austin, I finally had the opportunity to dine in this famous restaurant and see what all the hype was about. Well the hype was right, and the amount of people that filled the restaurant on a Wednesday was also very telling to its popularity. We had to make a reservation two weeks ahead of time, and I'm glad we did because as we walked in at opening time, the space became filled within minutes. Our service was amazing, and passed bites in the waiting area was also a very pleasant surprise. The ambience is perfect for such a well known upscale restaurant- classy but still sticking to Austin casual. The patio is also a cute and quaint area to hang out in and grab a drink while you wait for your table. We started off with Brussel sprouts and edamame off the regular menu. I had heard about these sprouts and as a huge fan of Brussel sprouts, I had to try. Oh my goodness- deliciousness in every bite! It had a slight barbecue tang to it, and was geniusly sauced. The edamame was also far more delicious than other restaurants'. My happy hour picks: yellowtail roll (simple, fresh, delicious- just the way I like my sushi), crunchy salmon (also more simple than I expected- which I liked), machi cure, and uchiveche. Out of the sashimi tastings, I enjoyed the uchiveche more, but both were great and fresh, with nice flavors. The apple chips were pretty tasty too.We had complementary flan and ice cream dessert, which was a little too syrupy but tasty nonetheless, to top off the night. Overall an excellent experience, and I was full from my picks. I am so overjoyed I finally got to try uchi before leaving Austin!",5.0 star rating

"We decided to give Taverna brunch a try this past Sunday since our friends had been there and said the sub 2$ mimosas and Bellinis were worth the trip. We arrived right before 10am and had our choice of any outdoor seat. Inside did look a little busier though. By the time we left (just after 11am) the place was slammed so getting their early is for sure encouraged.  He tried the chicken and waffles with a mango salsa which wasnt on the menu but seems to a regular daily special. We have had some pretty solid chicken and waffles in our day and unfortunately these did not compare especially at the cost of $17 for the plate. The chicken lacked any real distinct flavor and a good crisp. The waffles were fine and the mango salsa was good but ultimately when you want good chicken and waffles, its all about the chicken and the waffles, not what you put on top. She had the eggs al forno at the request the eggs be closer to over medium than runny.  It was pretty descent but nothing spectacular. Overall we are glad to have experienced brunch at Taverna since we know we would probably go somewhere else for Brunch next time. We went straight to Banger's after the meal and concluded we would have rather spent the money on food there than at Taverna. If you are downtown and want some great, cheap mimoasas it is hard to go wrong at Taverna but check out somewhere like Moonshine for a much better brunch and more variety.",3.0 star rating

"Worst time ever. On my birthday. I realize that it was Sunday during acl but we waited 30 minutes over our projected time (of an hour), finally sat down and our waiter comes up and has the nerve to literally sit down at our table to take our order. I guess that's so we think he's cool or something? Food took forever, they were out of everything, but didn't let us know they were out of syrup until the DRY French toast showed up. Just bad all around. Embarrassing place to take my out of town guests.",1.0 star rating
"If this was about the dish I had yesterday alone, this place would get 2 stars at best. In fact, let's go ahead and get that out of the way: I've never had worst ""tuna tar tar"" in my life than what they served me. I took a photo of it, and the comments went like this, ""That looks worst than cat food!"" It was. I don't know how you can mess up such a simple dish, but trust me. NEVER ORDER THAT HERE.Now, onto why I don't completely hate Taverna... I love $1 mimosas, patios, and I guess that's about it. They've got great drink specials during brunch, a nice view of downtown, and the service was alright despite them being slammed on a Sunday morning. Other dishes I've had here have been decent, although a little pricey. Pro-tip: eat outside if you don't like loud restaurants. The noise level can get pretty intense when they're busy.",3.0 star rating

"Apparently I need to come here for brunch and order a bunch of $1 mimosas! And I shall, soon enough... but what I did instead was stop in for a late lunch and order a gluten-free margherita pizza. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with it. See, Taverna has this awesome menu with interesting taste combos and beautiful sounding specials. All of the risotto descriptions I read were just gorgeous (I fully regret not trying some). Since every dish sounded exciting, I expected the presentation and flavors of a classic pizza to at least be somewhat impressive. Instead, I had one of the least tasty gluten-free pizzas I've ever eaten. What a bummer. Another thing that bummed me out: our pizza was listed at  $11 on the gluten-free menu, but it cost $13 on our ticket. I'm used to an extra two bucks being tacked onto a gluten-free dish, that's totally fine. But why would you make a separate menu with the wrong prices listed? Most dishes (on both menus) were pretty costly, but I think if the rest of the food tastes as brilliant as it sounds, it'll be worth the dough. I'll definitely be back to the Fort Worth location for an evening of risotto!",3.0 star rating
"I thought the food was okay. We finished our appetizers before our drinks came. The staff is very unprofessional. Making jokes between each other in front of customers.  At one point I saw one of the servers give the middle finger to another server. I've worked in the industry before and I know that this goes on in the back of the house but that is where it stays.

"Greatly adds to the atmosphere of the 2nd Street District in Austin and the ideal place to people watch any time of year. When it's warm, there's nothing like sitting outside and watching the town pass by and it's one of my best weekend routines with friends. It's especially pleasant when I can hear the outdoor band from the W Hotel right from the comfort of my table, making it feel like the show is just for me.The best deal is the $2 mimosas deal for weekend brunches. They aren't the best mimosas and are sometimes flat, but it's a good deal nonetheless. The food is exceptional and the prices are very reasonable. I always recommend this place to anyone who comes in from out of town and my parents insist on going there every time they visit.Don't fill up on the focaccia bread too much, though it's hard to resist.",4.0 star rating

It is still the best pizza happy hour around downtown--So happy the service is picking up!",4.0 star rating
Food here was pretty decent. The waiter GIenn was just extremely rude. I knew that when he saw that we were younger that he immediately was uninterested in giving us great service.

"The hostesses were extremely rude to me and my wife. We asked to be seated inside where there were visibly tables available, and they kept insisting for us to sit outside. I reiterated that we wanted to sit inside and they said it will be 15 minutes before we could be seated. I pointed to the multiple tables that were open and the hostess said in a rude tone 'fine I'll sit you over here' and stormed over to the table and threw or menus on the table and walked off. We were not rude in any way and didn't deserve this treatment. Any management reading this please have a talk with the hostesses on their attitude and how to treat paying customers. Also they changed the mix they use for the bellinis and they now taste horrible. They used to be pink and very delicious, and now they are extremely tart and disappointing. The entire staff seemed to have an attitude we have been here over 50 times over the past 5 years and not sure we will be coming back. Seems like they are comprising their quality of ingredients to increase their profits. For what they are charging here it is just not up to par. Again we have been coming here for several years and it has steadily declined. It's a shame this used to be our favorite brunch spot but not anymore.",2.0 star rating
"I had the smoked scottish salmon. The asparagus in mango relish was delicious and the potatoes with cheese? and bacon were interesting (in a good way). I would definitely go again if I felt the prices were more in-line with the value. I would be comfortable paying around the $15-18 range for my dish, but it came out to about $22. Perhaps I'm just being overly stingy, but I just remember the thought being on my mind over the course of the meal. The venue itself has a nice italian/homey date-night type feel with great service.

However, I'm disappointed the fresh, local food doesn't taste better.  I had a similar experience at Trace in Seattle, nice ambience, average food.

"Park for a song at the City Hall garage, and head across the street towards the deathstar-in-a-good-way W Hotel.  You'll dig the atmosphere at Trace, where you probably want to sit on the comfortable minimally-styled patio, rather than the fussy, overdecorated indoor dining room.Grab a drink from the impressive cocktail or wine list.  If you have the crab or the soup for an appetizer, you'll be pleased with the delicate flavors that avoid bombast in favor of elegant subtlety.  The shrimp escabeche entree will hit all your spots and be the hit of the night, but you'll be disappointed in the duo of pork, which offers flavorless braised meat and overcooked tenderloin.Your server might lose focus, maintaining a standoffish attitude throughout the dinner.  But the dessert will come, with its sophisticated contrasts of salty and sweet, and bring your mood back up.  When your check comes, you'll be slightly alarmed at the price of it all, but not willing to give up on a promising new restaurant.  Not just yet.",3.0 star rating

"My experience at Trace was phenomenal. My friend and I went there for dinner and ordered the Bluebonnet Garden Salad, the Sea Bass Crudo, the Handmade Strozzapreti Pasta, the Grilled Whole Fish and for dessert, a sampler of the sorbets.The place is elegant but not stuffy or pretentious. But let's get to what really matters: the food. I have to eat gluten free so I didn't get to taste the pasta. However, I did smell it (I had to) and the smell alone was heavenly. I was able to eat everything else and every bite was as good as the first.Our waiter, Michael, was AH-MAZING. He was never rushed and took his time to explain the food as well as make recommendations, all of which we took. Michael's recommendations were right on the money. He would even double check with the chef to make sure that a dish was completely gluten-free. They were very accommodating to my restrictions. My dining companion and I at some point commented that the Sea Bass Crudo and the Grilled Whole Fish reminded us of some of the dishes at Uchiko (one of our favorites). Little did we know at the time that chef de cuisine, Ben Hightower, had recently completed a tenure there. You can definitely see the influences on the two fish dishes we had but it was by no means just a copy of the Uchiko dishes. He has developed his own twist - the surprising flavors blend into a symphony in your mouth. I wanted to lick the plates.Now on the most delicious sorbet trio I've ever tasted. The trio: cherry, mixed berry and champagne. All three were so delicious but the champagne one was ridiculous. It tasted SO. GOOD. The pastry chef is obviously up to the challenge of making the desserts just as memorable as the main courses. And OH EM GOD were those sorbets memorable.I wouldn't say Trace is overpriced as I've seen other commentators state. Is it pricey? Sure. But is it worth it? Absolutely.",5.0 star rating
"Just got back from dinner at Trace and we were very impressed.AS you might expect, this place is pretty hipster.  For reasons I won't go into here, we decided to bring our toddler along for dinner - but made the earliest reservation possible (5:30) thinking it wouldn't be a big deal.Our server - Micah - was so awesome with our toddler.  As a parent, that really goes a long way.We wanted to be quick with our meal, so we ordered lots of little things:My wife had the vegetable soup which she really enjoyed.  I had some type of seafood chowder which has big chunks of scallops and lobster - it was also seasoned well and tasted great.The truffle mac and cheese was a favorite for both of us - we almost ordered another  plate of it.The brussel sprouts were very good, though not Uchiko good - and it is hard to mess them as with a rich/buttery sauce they were in.  The fries were fries.... seasoned well, but hard to screw up.The banana pudding dessert (with dark chocolate sauce and salted peanut ice cream) was something we fought over to end the night - it was sensational.My wife and I have ate at many fine restaurants, and while this was very good, for us it was the wonderful service of Micah that will stand out along with the food/ambiance.  He made an otherwise mildly stressful event (bring a young child to a hip/cool restaurant) a very pleasant affair for us - thank you.",5.0 star rating

"Interesting name.  TRACE.  After dining there this past Sunday, trying the ""small plates"" and drinks, I finally know how they got their name.There was a TRACE amount of taste!!!  We got the small plate of sausages.  It was one of the most bland plate of sausages/meat I've ever tasted.  I didn't expect it to be the quality of a sausage in Austria or Germany.  However, if they were going to charge that much for tasteless meat, don't call it sausage.  There was a TRACE amount of food.  The $10 salad was basically a small plate of a bunch of little chopped up tomatoes without any real presentation, taste, or distinction (other than being ridiculously, insultingly small amount of food fit for birds).There was a TRACE amount of creativity.  The hotel and restaurant's decor is very sleek.  Unfortunately, that did not bode well for the food dishes.  The pork belly tacos were unabashedly unimaginative. The service was very good, and the staff was very friendly and responsive.  However, there is a lower than TRACE chance that I'll be back to this restaurant.  Unfortunately, we couldn't leave fast enough before leaving a BIG TRACE on our bill.  Big bill for a TRACE amount of taste, food, and creativity.  Trace your steps and go back to where you just came from and avoid TRACE all together.",1.0 star rating

"I've been to Trace about 4 times now. My friends all love it. I however am underwhelmed. The food is usually alright, but for as expensive as it is, it should be better. I would give the food 4 stars. Love the mac and cheese and the fish is usually pretty good.The reason for this review was the waiter during our last visit. He was blonde...not sure of his name. Now let me clarify that the last couple times we have had wonderful service. This waiter however, was far from it. He somehow didn't order one of our entrees and blamed my friend for it. Instead of apologizing he fired back ""you didn't order anything""...umm...yes she did. When my same friend ordered some prosecco later in the night, it was warm. When I asked ""could we get like a cold one?"" I guess my frustration with him throughout the night had started to show, he mockingly said back...""yes, i can get you, like, a cold one""  Being someone in sales, I personally couldn't ever imagine treating a customer that way. The correct answer should have been, ""'im sorry about that ma'am, what would you like? ""I'm sorry ma'am I'll bring you a cold prosecco right out."" SORRY for asking you to do your job.

"I enjoy farm to table restaurants not only because of the concept but also because of the presentation of the dishes. We had the Market snack plate and the presentation was beautiful, in a rustic way, and everything we got on the plate/rustic wooden cutting board was delicious. Our favorite was the pimento cheese spread. The crab cakes were also very good. Nice and crispy on the outside with sweet juicy crab on the inside. I had the windy hill goat loin and it was very tasty. This was the first time that I had goat so I don't have anything to compare it to but I enjoyed it. The ragout that came with it was the star. The acid in it was perfect to lighten up the lamb, and the heirloom carrots were very tasty too. We ended the meal with the drunken donuts and.....holy crap! The dark chocolate sauce had tequila in it, the caramel sauce (my favorite) had bourbon in it, and the whip cream was made with vodka. I could have ate two of these desert portions by myself and they came with five donuts! Our waitress was great, and I liked how she brought out different wines for me to try when I was unsure about what I wanted. All and all I would recommend this restaurant to friends and would not mind coming back.",4.0 star rating

"Fabulous mixologist (good, because the wine menu is sadly disappointing) and great vibe. Service for us on a busy Saturday night was spot on.  I had guacamole, and a carrot dish. The carrots were crazy good, if a little pricey. My date had Pulpo (seared octopus leg) I wanted to hate it, but couldn't. I'll go back, because it's fun and chic, without hipster...  It is a tad pricey, that's some expensive real estate.",3.0 star rating
"We stopped in for a few drinks before dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the friendly atmosphere and rockstar bartenders. 2 drinks; could I really provide a 5-star review based on 2 drinks? Oh you wait and see.The Alma Blanca Margarita was made with a habanero-infused blanco tequila and began with a muddled fresh corn base. Seriously? I almost told the bartender to stop when the corn came out but I was in heaven when the ish hit my taste buds. The icing on the cake was hibiscus & rose-infused salt on the rim. A fragrant masterpiece!The El Cubico Margarita was made with a tobacco-infused tequila. Yes, tobacco. It smelled like it, it tasted like it and it lingered for a long time. The extras were vanilla brandy, grilled pineapple juice and saffron salt. Cigar smokers enjoy!",5.0 star rating
"Ive been to Austin 3 times in the last 18 months, and visited La condesa multiple times, for both lunch and dinner. We LOVED it our first time, hence returning. But our most recent visit, during the slow week between xmas and new years, was super underwhelming. The food was fine, nothing really to complain about, but the service was abysmal. Our waiter was so unbelievably uninterested in his job and serving us. Not im not asking you to put on a show, but something above dropping our food off would be appreciated. It was unfortunate, and I will have to stop recommending La Condesa to friends.",2.0 star rating
"Really fun, lively atmosphere. Trendy decor. Our server was very attentive. Great for groups. Casual dress. Good drink list. Has small area for outdoor seating. Food is delicious but a little over priced. Ordered guacamole for 7 and got a very small bowl. I'd come back, though!",4.0 star rating
"La Condesa is a nice addition to Austin.  In a land of mexican inspired food, it does it a little better and in a pretty classy way.  Located in the 2nd street district in downtown, it is a classy building with nice decor.  The outside patio lets you watch downtown and the indoors area is cozy and dimly lit in the evening.  The pisco sour was good, my bf's beer was ....beer.... i dunno, i can't remember what he had and i don' t like beer. We tried the scallop ceviche, delicious but smaaalll plate for the price.  My boyfriend go the reuben inspired taco and it was unique.  I got the steak tacos and they were great.  They broil cheese on top of extremely tender steak and delicious bacon tortillas.   we got some free love from the kitchen and had a super tasty side dish of brussel sprouts, bacon and grapes.  The desserts here really stand out.  Matt Zepeda was the pastry chef that night and they were not only beautiful and unique in concept, they tasted amazing.  We got a niiiice spread 'cause we know people ; )The birthday cake ice cream is sooo feel good delicious. The dulce de leche sponge cake with caramel popcorn and corn (?) ice cream was indulgent!  we ended our meal with an elegant, not too sweet beet cake and then two tasty blondie ice cream cakes.  This is grown up dessert, leave the kids at home.  the one critique I have is the service.  there was confusion as to who our waiter was when we arrived.  also, the table next to us had a couple that didn't speak fluent english (but were TOTALLY understandable) and they had service problems, no one paid attention to them for awhile when they were seated and then they continued to be forgotten. the waiter who did pay attention to them seemed to be a little snobby or put out by it all. this is why they did not get 5 stars from me.",4.0 star rating

"In a city with so many great options for Mexican food and tacos, I'm not sure why this place is as popular as it is. It's downtown, and in an interesting space, but the food is overpriced. Chips and salsa aren't complimentary, which I could understand for something really different. But the salsa sampler was 4 tiny cups of salsas that were different colors but were only marginally different in taste. The tortas were good and served with homemade chips and a nice fresh green salad. But for the price I expected something more.",3.0 star rating

"We had an interesting experience here. We came with a large group for happy hour on a Thursday, and let our server know that we would be paying separately. The service was decent; they were getting crowded so we chalked the wait for drinks up to how busy they were getting.The happy hour prices were really reasonable, and the drinks tasted great (the Alma Blanca comes highly recommended!), especially at $6.00. Then came the problem. When it came time to pay our bill, we were informed that she couldn't split the checks on the computer. We had to all go around and write down what we had and how much to charge our cards, which with liquor/food taxes and gratuity nuances is more difficult to do than you might think. Of course, it didn't all add up and she had to come back to the table and add more on to everyone's check, and because of an entry error on her part we all ended up paying more to cover her error (she charged one card 35.00 when we wrote down 70.00, so somehow we all paid the difference). Long story short, I paid $21.00 for two drinks priced at $6.00. The whole payment experience itself took over 30 minutes, and by the end I was ready to leave my card there and rappell off the patio to my next destination rather than wait any longer for them to figure it out.In this day and age, I don't understand how a restaurant does not have a system that is able to split checks or payments, especially one that has such great happy hour potential. I've put in 6 years of time as a server in the foodservice industry, and it blows my mind that I run into this so often in Austin. It could have just been the server's apathy, but I just don't know how anyone would choose that kind of headache over just using the computer to manage the ordering/billing process.This establishment needs to get with the times!",2.0 star rating
"It's mom's weekend for our UT senior daughter and we had brunch at La Condesa.  It was our first visit; we ate inside on this April Saturday.  We started with classic guac--which was very, very tasty.  The brunch menu had several options that I wanted to order.  Our table had Huevos Rancheros with a side of chorizo, Huevos Condesa and Chilangos.  The combination of the Quinoa with the chorizo on the Chilangos was masterful.   We loved the roasted poblanos in the Huevos Condesa.  We also ordered a side of street corn.  Each of the dishes was well prepared, creative and very delicious.  The service was well done.  Now I'm interested in coming back for dinner to get the brussel sprouts and chicken mole.  This is a great spot.  Will definitely be back!  Oh and I should address the portion size several others commented on.  Each of the three of us ate brunch and there was so much food, we were all stuffed!  I don't eat a lot but I couldn't finish my huevos condesa, even after giving a portion to my daughter and husband.",5.0 star rating
"I'm not from Austin but I read that this place was a must try on Pinterest. It's definitely a cute place and it has a very nice vibe to it. That's one of the reasons why I wanted to try it so badly, however, I was a bit disappointed. I think one of the issues I had was that it seems pretty pricey for the amount of food that you get. I ordered the Pollo Rostizado tacos. The order comes with 2, but no sides, you have to order those separately, which was a huge disappointment. I didn't really care for the corn tortillas, they were pretty bland and the tacos weren't stuffed and kinda small in my opinion. I figured since you get no sides that the tacos should be a good size, but that wasn't the case. The tacos weren't too bad, but not the best. I also ordered the elote and I thought it was pretty good. For desert, we ordered the Dulce de Leche. That was the best part of my meal and I truly enjoyed the dessert. I also ordered the Watermelon Elderflower Martini, it was also pretty good. I love Mexican food, however, I wouldn't consider this place a Mexican restaurant. It's more like Tex-Mex. If you're truly in the mood for Mexican food, I think you're better off going to a taqueria.",3.0 star rating

"The drinks are delicious. +1 star.Having to convince our waiter that my food order never came. -3 stars.I ordered something fancy, the Tuétano (""roasted bone marrow, smoked bacon, poblanos, charred tomato, parsley, radish, marrow totopos""), one of the more expensive things on the menu.The waiter gave us an extensive lecture on how La Condesa is a tapas restaurant, without using the word ""tapas"" (he must have thought he was playing Taboo with us). Turns out it isn't really, anyway, but the food came out incrementally, mostly brought by other servers / runners.Around the time everyone else finished what they ordered, I despaired of receiving my dish, but was already pretty full on chips and guacamole. So I caught the server and told him that I just wanted him to know my dish had never arrived, but I was already full anyway, so just to make sure it didn't show up on the check. He stared at the table in disbelief, and said something like ""What? Oh, I'm sure I saw it on your table."" And then he began to peer around the people sitting at the table, as if one of us was hiding it on the chair beside them. Haha no, good sir, you've barely glanced at our table in the last hour or so, much less asked us how our food was. Then he said he would go check on something inside (we were sitting outside).Another person in my party picked up the check at the end of the meal, and it would have been rude to verify whether the plate was indeed taken off, but I did catch a peek of the total: $130. For four people ordering three dishes and a couple of drinks, I'm inclined to estimate that the plate wasn't taken off the bill (but I could be wrong).Either way, La Condesa, trying to argue with your customers when you screw up isn't cool.Go for the drinks. Then leave.",2.0 star rating
"It was literally just OK. I came in for a couple of drinks and a bite to eat and I got exactly that. The bar area was a ""seat yourself"" situation...I waited so long for a menu that I actually had to flag down a busser to bring me one. I then waited again for the server to stop by and take my drink/food order. I then waited a very long time for my food.So basically, my experience here was a lot of waiting. I didn't see that it was extraordinarily busy but I think the server was the only in that section. That aside, I still expect to be acknowledged/greeted when I sit down and checked on every so often.I gave them 3 stars because the chips and salsa and 2 tacos I ordered were pretty good. And the service wasn't bad, per se, just very slow.  I would probably try them again but they wouldn't be my first choice.",3.0 star rating
"Went with coworkers and ordered several things:- GUACAMOLE TASTING -- The watermelon guac was the best, but they were all great!- HUARACHE DE PANZA DE PUERCO - Looked great, and everyone said it was good, large portion, but I don't eat pork.- TOSTADAS DE CANGREJO - pretty good, but they were basically 3 small chips with the crab and dressings.- MOLE DOMINGUERO - had bacon fat, but I will say it was a large portion as well, and it was more red than brown if that helps to know what the mole might taste like.- CHILE RELLENO - delish! the quinoa was so well flavored, almost like pesto.- CARNE ASADA - I don't eat beef either, but everyone loved it!- PULPO - this was by far the best choice! the octopus was dense, but not chewy and  had a wonderful smoky savory flavor similar to beef.",5.0 star rating
"We used to go to this place when it first opened and my wife even arranged my 40th birthday party here because it was our absolute favorite! I am SO DISAPPOINTED, it's gone way down hill.  Cocktails are watered down, guacamole is mediocre. The street corn that used to be out of this world was dried out, overcooked but cold, I couldn't even eat it. Brussel sprouts were sitting in a pool of oil. Service was ok, not great. Price is very high, but we used to be okay paying for such a great experience.  We pretty much decided we're not going back.... And this is a minor complaint but they used to serve the best plantains and they are no longer on the menu.",2.0 star rating
We came here last night for dinner and were so impressed! The prices are high and you get small portions but it was great! I'm usually not into very fancy sushi and am picky but loved the salmon belly and yellowtail (Hama chili appetizer) and a rice dish which also had some yellowtail. The hot and cold sake was yummy and so was the Emilio Sav Blanc. We didn't realize there was a happy hour but since we were there in time we also tried the crispy salmon roll !

"Contrary to most people's reviews, I actually found this place to be underwhelming. Maybe I had really high expectations given this restaurant had the reputation of being one of the best Japanese restaurants in the US. I've been to many Japanese restaurants in SF, LA, and New York and Uchi would just be average in my opinion. The best dish of the night was probably the mushroom rice in stone pot. Super flavorful, garlicky and since I love mushrooms it just made that dish felt like a comfort food. The soft shell crab roll was also pretty amazing. Probably one of the best I've had ever.We ordered various sashimi and nigiri and most were pretty good but nothing that was mind blowing. The fish is of good quality but for sashimi and nigiri I always wish I get it right after the chef makes it at the sushi bar.If you're only in Austin for a few days, skip this restaurant and try all the yummy tex mex places. If you live in Austin, this is probably not a bad choice for decent Japanese food.",3.0 star rating
"I may have had high expectations for Uchi after reading that it was one of the greatest Japanese restaurants in the US - I've had better in NY. Food: 3 There were 6 of us and we ordered 3 of the Chef's Tasting Menu which is meant to be shared between 2 people. Honestly, I could have easily finished it myself. I didn't expect 7 of the 12 dishes to be a piece of sushi but I guess that's why they call it Chef's Tasting - you get what you get. The sushi was mediocre, the only piece that blew me away was the Foie Gras. Another dish was way too salty and it made me wonder if the Chef had even tasted what he/she was serving. Service: 3.5We had 9pm reservations on a Friday and it was pretty busy.  The waitress let us know they had to tweak 4 of our dishes because they ran out. I'm not sure if that would have made a difference in our experience. As for our server, she was great. :) Overall, I was extremely disappointed and felt that it was overpriced for the quality of food. I'd probably give it another try and just order individual dishes.",3.0 star rating

"My sushi soul is sad. Long story short, sushi lovers that expect quality, you will be disappointed. +Foie gras ice cream - amazing. Service was great, my waitress was wonderful, sample during the 20 min wait was nice. Fish quality fresh.-Overrated. I got the omakase and a drink, maki as an appetizer and I was starving at the end of my meal. Quality of the fish was fine, something items get flown over from Japan but portions were ridiculous. I'm talking about maki the size of a handroll and half the portion normally served at restaurants. Tiny pieces and slivers of fish served. It was the saddest omakese I've ever had. Maybe hipsters can be convinced to pay these prices for Uchi. Price isn't the issue - expensive sushi is worth it and should be expensive and what I paid was not worth the experience. I've had sushi in countless/various settings - low and high end, in Japan, Hawaii, California, all over the West Coast... this was the most hype and disappointment I've ever experienced from Yelp vs real life.P.S.

"Phenomenal! By far the best meal I had during my 6 day stay in Austin (sorry tex-mex & BBQ)! It's pricey but I thought everything was well worth it, especially for a special occasion. Service:  Our server was great! She gave excellent recommendations, was engaging and very attentive. She definitely made our experience what it was. Drinks:  They have lots of sake, wine and beer options. I don't remember any cocktails really standing out in my mind, but we stuck to a bottle of Prosecco, which paired great with all of our food. Food: All of the food is served in small tasting plates, so it was recommended to order about 3-5 dishes per person. We obviously indulged and got more than that, but it was worth it again! I don't remember every dish that we ordered, but I'll touch on some of the highlights:Cool Tastings:- Machi Cure: Unique, flavorful dish that is eaten almost like nachos with yellowtail and smoked yucca chipsHot Tastings:- Hamachi Nabe:  A fresh take on a fried rice bowl with a fried cracked over it tablesideSushi/Sashimi- Foie Gras:  This is how our meal was topped off and it was the perfect bite to end with, flavorful, rich and melts in your mouth- We tried 3 other types, which were all equally as satisfyingGreens:- Uchi Salad:  It's so simple with baby romaine that you grab with your hands and dip into the dressing, but it's simply delicious!I really think you could order most things off of the menu and be satisfied. We loved everything we had and the whole experience was very memorable. I would recommend to anyone in Austin for whatever the reason.

Uchi is my one of my favorite restaurant to eat at. I can say uchi ATX is much better than Dallas one :/ I love the flan dessert that ATX has to offer. I'm not a fan of flan but man!

Uchi is definitely on the pricy side but it's a good once in awhile place unless you're just baller status then by all means you can eat there everyday lol take me with you if you do go everyday. I'll just eat their flan and walu walu :) haha Their sushi rolls are on the weaker side in my opinion compared to other sushi places. I don't come here for the sushi rolls.

"The sushi here was really good.  We went for a bachelor party dinner and the staff greeted us with open arms.  I thought the restaurant closed later, but it actually closed at 10, but the staff there took care of us til 11:30pm.Salmon belly was really good and probably one of my favorites there.  They have a spicy scallop hand roll which was really spicy, I believe they use Thai chili to make it.  The yellowtail was also like butter and great.  I had never tried flounder, so we tried it here and that was also amazing.  We were sad that they don't serve toro due to their views on fishing bluefin tuna. The price wasn't bad, we had 7 bottles of sake and a bunch of beer, along with the food it came to what I would usually pay anywhere else. The nigiri is only one piece though, so keep that in mind when ordered.If I'm ever back in Austin, I will go to this place again.",5.0 star rating

Their happy hour is from 5:00 PM (open) to 6:30 PM. I recommend getting there about 10 minutes before opening. We did and we still had about a 20 minute wait. Also, the entire restaurant filled up fast! They have a complimentary valet so parking is hassle free. All in all just a great experience.",5.0 star rating
"Amazing Asian-fusion food! Probably the best I've ever had.I've heard so many good things about Uchi that I called in and made reservations 2 months in advance. Yeah, I'm a bit crazy in my planning. Like everyone said, portions are tiny, so I wouldn't recommend coming in here hungry. Happy hour is 5-6:30pm so that's a good way to save and also try a variety of food. Keep in mind this is a splurge meal! It is also quite loud in here so I would not recommend this for date night. Otherwise it looks trendy and beautiful inside.Now, onto the food... everything we had was great! My favorite dish was the mushroom nabe... it actually is pretty simple but so earthy, hearty, and umami-y. It cooks in a pot so the rice gets crispy. Mmm.. It was so delicious that my boyfriend and I were fighting for the last bite. I also recommend the hot rock dish where you get to cook your own scallops or wagyu beef, the short ribs, and machi cure (creative dish of yellowtail, yucca crisp, marcona almond, asian pear, garlic brittle). Overall a fun experience and I like how some of the dishes were interactive, like cooking your own meat. The dishes were all well thought out and we also had great service. Only minor gripe was that while I made reservations and had a few email conversations with the manager, we were offered complimentary dessert for my friend's birthday, which was supposed to be a surprise... but unfortunately they forgot about that and it was too awkward to mention anything to our server... oh well.If I'm ever in Austin again, I'd definitely come back!",4.0 star rating
"This is a 3 and a half star for me (maybe a bit as a reaction to the other effusive reviews and national press).  If lived in Austin I'd probably go regularly, but if the advertises how amazing it is compared to everything in America then you are going to get my criticism.I went and let the waiter order for us so we got a ton of different stuff. My overall critique.1. Many of the dishes were way too sweet.  This is a cheap trick that you don's see nearly that often in authentic cooking. The Brussels sprouts for example are nearly inedible, but several of the dishes were coyingly sweet2.  Rice is just fine.  Not the individual sort of rice feel you get from a really high end sushi joint3.

"There's a million reviews of this place, so no ground breaking news here. Simply wanted to add to the chorus of Uchi admirers! True story- whenever my husband and I plan on eating at Uchi, we don't eat the rest of the day to make sure we can gorge on all the deliciousness. Hands down, the Uchi Social Hour offers the best meal in the city for the price. As more and more restaurants open in Austin with $$$-$$$$ price tags, with mid-range quality food, Uchi stands up to the test of time. This past Monday, we arrived at 4:45 pm sharp to put our name on the list. As soon as the clock struck 5, we were seated at a table to begin.- Machi Cure: One of my favorite dishes of all time. If you don't like this dish, I seriously question your taste. One of the many dishes that showcases yellowtail, with a mix of sweetness and acidity. - Shag Roll: A delicious fried indulgence. Even though it's a tempura roll, it's perfectly light with a tasty squid ink sauce.- Negihama + Zero Sen Rolls: Both rolls showcase yellowtail and are a prime example of why Uchi is so good. Light on the rice, with just enough herbs and other additions so you can truly taste the fish.- Walu Walu: Another Uchi standard that I can't get enough of with the perfect mixture of a tart, yuzupon broth, paired with candied citrus and grilled escolar. I could wax poetic about the rest of the dishes, but you get the idea. Beyond the food, the staff of Uchi (and sister restaurant Uchiko) are by far the best in town. No hovering, quickly place plates and remove when needed, can answer any questions and are genuinely happy to work there. I've strayed from time to time, lured by the siren song of every new, hot restaurant opening, but I'll always return to Uchi.",5.0 star rating
"It's a touch painful to give this place two stars, because the service was prompt and amiable, the decor was unique and interesting, and the menu was different enough to be intriguing. But as far as the food goes, it was a consistent swing an' a miss.I applaud this place for trying a bold twist on the more conventional fare of the average Mexican joint; the gimmick of this place for those unfamiliar is that the dishes are meant to be shared family style, where a single plate gets split between the party (though this is optional, and you can opt to do things traditionally.) The menu is rather short, and everything is, for the most part, unique to this restaurant. It is also pricey. The guacamole is $12, and it is literally just every other restaurant's $5 guacamole. As for the rest of the food, while it wasn't bad, it's just not good enough to justify the steep prices in my opinion. However, if you're in the market for something unconventional and don't mind lightening your wallet, this might be a fun try! It just wasn't quite up our avenue.",2.0 star rating

"I am giving La Condesa 4 stars for overall experience and not one thing in particular. My experience began a bit oddly. My sister and I walked in around 7:30pm on a Thurs. As we entered we asked the hostess how long a wait for be for two people. She responded that it would be about 45 mins, but she has a table avail outside and inside. We asked what she meant and she just repeated it as if there was something wrong with us. There wasn't - her vagueness was just really strange. Anyway we opted for the seat outside and it was amazing. Great little patio. And no 45 min wait. As we sat and browsed the menu our waiter greeted us. Really nice guy, I believe his name was Jo? I could be wrong, but oh well. He was pretty awesome as he let us just relax instead of making us feel rushed. He made a few recommendations on what drinks to have, suggesting that the bartenders are well versed in tequila drinks. We took him up on that and crushed a few jalapeno infused margaritas. They are amazing. For our meal we decided to do a little sharing. For our apps we ordered the guacamole sampler, and the Mexican street corn. Both were fantastic - my fav guace was the chipotle offering.  Next up we ordered the the carnitas tacos. They were absolutely delicious, however they were not the best I've ever had, or even top 5. Def good quality and presentation, but they feel a bit short (they were still delicious). Finally for our sharing plates we ordered the Mole Dominguero's. That, I would say is prob the best mole sauce I have ever experienced. Words don't properly describe the flavors. Must try. My sister is a baker at Tartine in SF so she takes dessert VERY seriously. Since the pastry chef at La Condesa has been given some great accolades as of late we decided to try a few. The Hoja Santa was bonkers, and the boca negra blew my mind. I'm not even a sweets eater and I couldn't stop with both of these. All and all I'd say the food falls between 3 1/2 - 4 stars. The experience was def 4 stars. I'd come back next time I'm in Austin.",4.0 star rating
The ceviche is the only thing worth the exorbitant fees to dine here.  A complete sticker shock for a decent margarita and mediocre tapas.  The happy hour is good but you'll have to fight your way through the metrosexuals (remember that term?),3.0 star rating
"The most horrible Mexican food I ever tasted. Three dollar signs for Mexican food is just dumb. I went because people were ""showing us around Austin."" This was the saddest Mexican meal I ever had.Over priced.Small portions. Over salted. I got the Acapulco ceviche that came in a small sundae cup. It came with three small inch circular to tostada chips. I asked for more and the waiter gladly obliged to bring me more chips w my small 6oz, $14 ceviche cup.Venison taquito- which is actually too small tacos on flour tortillas which was over salted. All I tasted was salt. No other flavors.Classic margarita - goodMojito- don't bother. It was the worst Mojito ever.It someone tries to take you here, put your foot down and say no. Or else you will be very disappointed and hungry after your meal. You will also end up paying $40 per person after too.",1.0 star rating

"If you like chicken that's been sitting in trash cans in its own juice before it's cooked, come here. I'm surprised nobody has caught salmonella eating here. The good reviews are just people who decided to jump on the hype wagon, but if you saw how the food was cared for in the kitchen, you would probably go somewhere else.

"My husband and I really enjoy authentic Mexican - but we appreciate the talented Chefs of La Condesa which are without a doubt impressive ten fold. We have been to three of the SFC (Spring Bounty/Fall Harvest?) events held at La Condesa which are unique, important to community and culinary joys as well. Anyone that can participate should. The Happy Hour menu can be seen on-line and offers individual portions to get a grasp of the flavor combinations of many items. Every item was unique in preparation and flare. The drink has many signature and classic options as well as a full bar and beer selection. They have half a page dedicated to the tequila selection!Ample seating is able to outside or inside and our waitresses have always been friendly as we are and knowledgeable! The decor and vibe is the perfect combination of simple and fancy. We have often brought friends and colleges here and the experience is quality each time.

"My wife and I were in from Chicago and feel that we have quite a bit of fine Mexican dining to reflect on for the sake of comparison. From the guacamole and salsa sampler to the tacos to the sublime desserts, we were stunned by the smoky and complex tastes.... Truly spectacular if you are looking for Mexican in Austin... I even had to shazam several cool tunes that made the vibe perfect. If we are ever back in Austin, we will be back here.... We were staying at the Hyatt Lost Pines, and when we asked the concierge where we should try for Mexican food, he kinda shrugged.... We will fix that as soon as we get back.",5.0 star rating
"First a little background. I am a consultant and besides working late hours and traveling, my other job is sampling local fair. La Condesa disappointed on multiple levels despite is 4 star rating at the time of writing this review. First, the queso was essentially a melted block of cheese with minimal flavor. Secondly, for premium prices, the service was extremely lacking. Thirdly, as a heads up to anyone reading, they will refuse to split a check among patrons (4) and an automatic gratuity of 20% was added to our bill. Normally, I wouldn't bother to write a review but this one struck a chord because of the waitress's condescending attitude and car salesperson-like tactics to elevate our purchase amount. Highly disappointed with our choice for an otherwise nice evening out.",1.0 star rating
"Their drinks are great and the decor is awesome.They recently changed the format of the restaurant to family style dishes, that still take way too long to arrive at your table. They basically have you wait between servings so you order more drinks. Thankfully, their drinks are pretty good.None of the dishes are particularly good or bad. Everything is just kind of ""meh"". If you're visiting Austin, go here for a drink and then go eat somewhere else downtown.If you're a local, you should know better than to actually eat here.PS- LIke I said ,their drinks are good, but stay away from the ""tobacco infused"" drink, it tastes like someone left a cigarette in a cup of booze overnight.",2.0 star rating
"I ate here last night with a guest from Dallas.  The food was good (and pretty), but the servings are tiny.  If it weren't for lots of chips and salsa I'd have gone home hungry.  I first ordered the Chochoyotes, but they were out of that, so i switched to the Hamachi cerviche.  It was really tasty, but tiny.  My companion had Huarache De Hongos Y Huitlacoche which was really good (she gave me a bite) and it was a bit more substantial.Part of my problem was not understanding the menu, so I didn't know what was meal-sized and what were essentially tastes of something.  The prices gave no clue to the quantity of each dish. It was my fault that I didn't ask the waiter more questions, but I don't like dinner to be that complicated where I have to ask what the listed ingredients are. Do you know that ""huitlacoche"" is a fungus that grows on corn?  I do now, and it tastes wonderful.The house margaritas were great, and the multiple staff members who came to our table for different reasons were polite and friendly.  I'd have no problem coming back here for drinks and chips & salsa, but for a real meal this mid-western farm boy would be much happier at Lambert's across the street (which had a very long waiting list when we tried to go there first).",3.0 star rating
"I had read this was one of the best Mexican restaurants in the nation.  Our visit of four did not confirm this to be the case.  Nice place, great location, good food quality, unique dishes, but nothing special.  For the most part, you just order a bunch of items for the table, family style, and they deliver them as they are ready to be served.The prices were way way out of line.  We started with $18 quacamole served with a basket of small broken chips.  We then had ceviche, the entire content could have fit on one table spoon, for a price of $16.  Great taste, but poor value.  Then two simple chicken tacos for $12 followed by some pulled pork and black beans for a similar price.  Both O.K. but nothing special.  Then one small chile relleno , cut into four small  pieces, for $19.Just disappointed it was so plain, yet so expensive.",2.0 star rating

"LOVE LOVE LOVE BarChi Sushi! I'm pretty dedicated to certain Sushi places and tend to not explore out but I am glad I did. Bar is located in the Warehouse District and open late! A couple of girlfriends and myself decided to go to reverse happy hour and loved it! We sat at the bar and order several drinks. Reasonable price martinis for the bar and area we were in. The bartender was great. Super sweet and new his stuff! Even the regulars who came in were just awesome! They seem to take care of their regulars! We moved to the back area of the restaurant to eat. The table was huge!  We could have had someone lay down on the table and eat sushi off of them! Plenty of room to just eat everything. They do offer a regular happy hour and than a reverse happy hour that starts at 10 pm. First off thanks management for providing that. Not all of us have 9 to 5 jobs where we can hit up the happy hours around time! Their regular pricing on sushi is about average on good quality sushi. But the prices on the happy hour are even better! We order Watermelon Martinis, Veg Tempuras, Oyster Shooters, Pepper tuna (WHICH WAS THE BOMB!!!!!!!! so delicious) Salmon/Tuna/Yellow tail Sushi, Sake Bombs, and so much more. No one spent more than 40 bucks per person. Our waiter was super great! Very nice and helpful! Didn't mind the indecisiveness of each of us and even took our order before Happy hour. He didn't put it in until 10 but it was prepared. Place is very contemporary looking and clean. I am a huge fan of theirs! If you are a Sushi fan, you have to stop by for sure.",5.0 star rating
"I've tried sushi all over Austin and have been sadly disappointed. Finally after doing some hard searching, I've found my go to fresh sushi.

"My husband and I came in on Sunday and were pleasantly suprised to hear that they have Happy Hour prices (food and drinks) all day/night on Sundays.  It's a good deal.  We had a spicy tuna roll (delicious, mouthwatering tuna), an ""Austin Roll"" which had a variety of different fish (salmon and some others that I can't remember, but it all worked well together), and a crunchy shrimp roll (tempura shrimp).  The happy hour prices were $4.50 per roll.  They were all good size rolls.  We also had 2 small house salads which had a delicious creamy ginger dressing and 2 miso soups.  The meal was quite filling for the two of us.  My husband had a small Saporo ($3.50) and I had a house-made cold Pineapple Sake which was out of this world.  The ambience is very hip and trendy.  They definitely put a lot of money into the decor and it creates a nice atmosphere for a date or a romantic night.  I will definitely go back soon for that spicy tuna!!",4.0 star rating
"Decor is chic and modern and wait staff was attentive. The atmosphere is a bit busy since they are the only place open for food after 11pm. I love the fact that they have a happy hour from 10pm-1am.

I mean it's kind of hard to mess that up so I don't think that deserves anything special. The three stars are because of non-food issues. 1. the wait was ridiculous2. the music was WAY too loud. I couldn't even hear my friends speak at a normal volume without asking ""huh?"", ""what?"" I am convinced I lost 0.000063% of my hearing over dinner lol3. one bathroom (toliet) per gender.

We waited 28 minutes for the food to come out.  Sashimi was yummy but the maki rolls were too thin and tasted just ok.

My favorite sushi in town is at Musashino and Mikado. I can't help but feel we should've tried Soto tonight instead but we came here since we were already downtown.",2.0 star rating
"Great drink specials and appetizers during happy hour (both regular and reverse.) Try the Bloody Sake Mary if you're into spicy drinks. In my opinion, the sushi is average. I've been for dinner though once and it was pretty good. The sea bass was super buttery! The wasabi mashed potatoes were weird because of the slightly hard, chewy texture they had. Be careful if you have a gluten allergy. We asked about gluten-free options and no one really had a clue. We were assured items could be made gluten-free and my friend made choices that seemed gluten-free but she still ended up getting sick.",3.0 star rating
I've been going to this place for years now.  Their sushi is fresh and their prices are reasonable.  Their sake bombs are great and pretty cheap during Happy Hour.  The environment is fun for a date night or night out with friends.  Their teppan Mika is very good and their cocktails are tasty (albeit strong).  Solid choice.,4.0 star rating

The happy hour prices and selection is really good and I highly recommend it.  Their Sake Bloody Mary's are very spicy and delicious. And their food is fresh and the portions just right. The downside was the service. Our waitress came close to ignoring us (empty water glasses, etc) and I certainly wouldn't call her friendly. The music is loud but you can still have a conversation just fine. The bar smells a bit like the rest room which is around the corner. The worst part was that we were sitting at our table with a plate full of sushi in front of us and the manager came over and asked us to give up our table and ""move our conversation to the bar.""  He said that they needed the table. Now considering that we were still eating AND we hadn't even been given the check as a hint to leave this was shocking. And, to be clear, we ordered plenty of food and two alcoholic drinks for four of us (no, we weren't drunk or loud in any way). I'm appalled.",2.0 star rating

"$1 Mimosas and Bellinis! In.I'm going to start out talking about other people's food and our appetizers, as I wasn't as impressed with my own meal. The bread is good, lol. But they should really not, pre-make the olive oil/vinegar combo, as..when you dip, you only get the olive oil...until the very end of your dipping bowl. I had heard of the rave of the pizza, so we had to get one to share for the table. I ONLY do meat pizzas, so clearly the obvious choice was Pizza al salamino piccante. (It came down to either the spicy salami, or the italian sausage) Delicious, thin, light, crisp, yum. I could have had one for myself.I had the Classic Eggs Benedict, but the crabmeat came out a little dry. If I could do a redo, I'd order the ""Eggs al forno all 'olio tartufato.""

"Came here on a cold Sunday night and wasn't surprised to see the dining room was only half filled. I dined with three of my friends and we started off with the focaccia appetizer. Highly recommended if you love dipping in balsamic and olive oil. It was piping hot and the perfect combination of crispy and doughy. I couldn't get enough of it! It's also a good size for 3-4 people to share. I was only impressed with half of the entrees ordered. Thankfully, one of them was mine! I ordered the risotto with diver scallops, grape tomatoes, and lemon confit. The plate was served with two perfectly seared scallops and they were amazing. It was my first time having risotto so I can't compare to anything, but I enjoyed it immensely. My friend next to me ordered the pan seared sea bass and it was so good, I couldn't stop digging out of her plate. I've never had such well-prepared sea bass!My other two friends ordered pasta dishes and I was less than impressed with both of them. Can't remember the names of the dishes but one was a scampi and the other was a truffle cream. They were both served with the same type of pasta and I wasn't a fan of it. Too thin and too soggy!We also ordered the carrot cake and creme brulee for dessert! Highly recommended :)",4.0 star rating
"Brunch Review...So Austin has come a long way since I last lived here. Circa 2003/2005, there was no ""Sundae Fundae"" in this town. I had to go to Houston or Dallas for that. Now, there seems to be a sizable list on the Sunday afternoon drinking rotation, and apparently Taverna is the first stop - and for a few reasons...Patio dining$1 mimosasDecent blood marysLoooong wait. About 45 min for our party of six. And they won't seat you until every. single. person. ... is there. Tables don't turn too fast since, well, those $1 mimosas keep many folks camping out after their brunch.However, for as packed, chaotic and crazy this place gets, I was impressed with the service. Our drinks were always filled, and the food came out at warp speed.I ordered the eggs Benedict with my choice of crab meat rather than ham (yuck!). Only one of my English muffins had crab though. No big deal considering my ""hangover"" was more interested in the carby roasted potatoes and muffins. I'd love to come back and check out their dinner.

"""9/11 at Taverna: Drag Queen Brunch, and the Return of L's Boobs""When I woke up in my dorm room at Trinity University on September 11th, 2001, I only did so because my phone wouldn't stop ringing, and it appeared as if skyscrapers were falling apart in New York City. I literally almost slept through the whole thing. Of course we all have our ""where were we"" stories, and I remember listening to my friend cry over the phone after hearing my roommate's mother's disarmingly blasé voice mails concerning the whole situation. I finally got dressed (in a Levi's (?) shirt, of all brands; girl, I was a MESS that day), called my dad who's from Jordan and told him they were probably going to round him up and put him in a concentration camp like in ""The Siege"", then hung up and headed to the impromptu church service at the chapel.Ten years later, I found myself saying the ""Our Father"" again with my church family at St. David's Episcopal, just like all of us students and professors did at the chapel that terrible morning. I always thought it was one of the most poignant Lord's Prayer I have probably ever recited. After some quiet reflection during the service this year, and a liturgy that incorporated the solemn memorial of the day, I had enough of being depressed and decided to do what any red-blooded American would do after church: go a drag brunch. I was meeting my friends L and L's Boobs, whom you may remember from my review of the Driskill Bar. L's Boobs paid for my drinks at the midterm election party there last year, and I hadn't been out with them since. I put our name down for 2 at 1:00 PM sharp, and the wait was 35-40 minutes. L was in a cab on the way, so I saddled up to the bar for the usual round of pre-brunch cocktails. Through the growing haze of my $2 mixture of 3 vodkas and 3 juices, I said hello to a friend of mine from Trinity who happened to be there that afternoon as well; he's an actor now, and I remember seeing him in a gay indie movie he recommended...something about a desert, a hotel, and him as a top in a sex scene; I couldn't remember the name of the film, and I still don't. Oh well. Personally, I think he's adorable. L and I were seated at one of the tables for 2, and we asked for bellinis with a standing order they be refilled until we said to stop. I ordered the smoked salmon and bagels, and L opted for the Belgian waffle and fruit. When our food came, she dryly stated holding her bellini that she ordered food for a 5 year old, and booze meant for a 65 year old alcoholic. She almost made me spit my drink out on L's Boobs. She said her waffle was OK, and it seemed like it came topped with plenty of fresh berries. I'll be honest: something about their cream cheese was off (I want the thick kind, not that bullshit ""whipped"" version they tout nowadays), but other than that, it was fine. An order of breakfast potatoes rounded out the meal, although they were clearly liberal with the pepper. Our waitress had an overloaded section, but she did a fine job keeping up as best she could. I appreciated she wished us a ""Happy Pride"" when we were leaving. But still--how could she just *assume* I was gay?Biggest disappointment? Not enough drag queens. I saw Nadine Hughes and a friend of hers hanging out by the bar, but when I heard ""Drag Brunch"", I thought that would imply a running show in the corner or guest drag queen waitresses. It was basically Taverna on a Sunday with a couple of drag queens in the mix. They passed out some Absolut swag that I'll absolutely never use, but it was nice to see them there. Not sure who this ""Mr. Pride 2011"" dude was, but he was there and working the room, too. As I lit up my cigarette on the way out, I thought how this was such a perfect Nathan-style observation of the 9/11 anniversary. Like my quick tip from the day said: Nothing tells the terrorists ""We won't be kept down"" like gays, Absolut Pride Punch, bagels & lox, and some fierce drag queens. God bless America.",3.0 star rating

It seems that every time I go here however, the wait staff isn't all that great. Not unfriendly, just slow and doesn't come around to the table much. They do have a great and wide selection of wine here. The few times I have gone, I have gotten the California pizza, eggplant parmigiana, house salad and a few other things. The house salad isn't that great, but it's pretty cheap, so no harm no foul. The pizzas they have here a pretty good. I would recommend getting one of them!",3.0 star rating

Chain, No Flavor to Food, Restaurant Organization Bad, Service Quality Good.Service = My friend and I were walking by and decided we would try this place due to the crowd. Weird Right? I was fine with the 30 min wait time. After 40 we were told every table that was being cleaned was for us. It took a few tables but we got one. We had 4 different people waiting on us, it got confusing who to talk to after a while. Drinks was one male, food was another female, bread was another male, and plates off the table was another female. Mind Blown, I know!Food = Not Impressed. I can't remember the name of what I had but it was a cream sauce with chicken, mushrooms, and ruffle oil. It tasted like a high quality frozen dinner. The pasta was very limp, way too much sauce, and all you could taste was the truffle oil. The chicken was OK. I was not impressed. Not worth $15.Spaghetti with turkey meatballs. It LOOKED GREAT! It sadly had NO TASTE. IT was weird. It looks like they make everything there in house but forgot to add the spices, salt, and pepper. It had chunky veggies in it, which I like, but it didn't matter. There really was no flavor. The turkey meatballs were OK, nothing great. I have had better and cheaper places.Bread =  It is not the fresh baked bread your are thinking. It reminds me of the old 90's Friendship bread. I looked at everyone's plates and I have to say, nothing looked amazingly awesome. Presentation of the food here lacks big time! I don't see a reason to return unless I just want to get wasted on $1 mimosas on Sunday, but who am I to say anything, their business model seems to work splendidly.",2.0 star rating
"Very solid deliciousness. I've been here for dinner once and brunch a couple times. $1 mimosas now seem to be $2 mimosas. Does anyone mind? Not really. Still pretty unbeatable; even though they come in the annoyingly small champagne glasses, our server was always prompt and mindful if and when they needed replacing.The food choices on the brunch menu are whittled down to the few essentials but from what I can tell, they are all done *really well*. Take note of the daily/weekly specials on the board--this is one of the few places where I'm always really impressed by the specials. Crabmeat eggs benedict was my choice a few weeks ago, and it was perfection. Another friend had the same but with ham (also a very happy camper) and my other friend says she always has to get the risotto with foccacia and can't bring herself to stray from it.This is somewhere to go when you don't want a fuss but want something really satisfying that isn't too heavy or pretentious. Good prices too, especially for the quality.",4.0 star rating
"Taverna is a great place for lunch, dinner, or brunch!A few of my favorite menu items:-$1 mimosas at brunch-Focaccia flatbread appetizer-Garganella al pomodoro - pasta with delicious basil tomato sauce-Beignets with a yummy orange sauce",5.0 star rating
Pretty average breakfast in a prime location. I got the hash with hollandaise sauce. It was heave on the meat and very rich. Great atmosphere with wooden and marble tables. Open style kitchen with wood fired. Great menu selection with seafood and pasta,3.0 star rating
"Hostess was extremely rude and lacked common sense. They could not seat more than half of the party because everyone was not present. Additionally, no internationalids are accepted even though a world renowned and internationally attended university is a few blocks up. The mood was very racist and the staff was just dumb as a nail. Used to be a nice place.",1.0 star rating

"I've been here three times over the past couple of years for happy hour and I have never been disappointed. The bloody sake mary's are unique and delicious. Actually, my yelp profile picture was taken at Bar Chi. That was the day I decided I wanted to be a yelper, and you know what, I can't believe I haven't reviewed them yet.5 stars! Keep up the good work.",5.0 star rating
I really think this place is about 3.5 stars. The happy hour is what keeps me coming back. The drink specials are great and the HH food menu provides a great selection. The sushi rolls are good/standard but somewhat unmemorable. I do enjoy those yummy Lychee martinis and oyster shooters though.Great for a date or for a large group of friends wanting to throw back a few drinks while sharing lots and lots of sushi.,4.0 star rating
"Best sushi happy hour in town!!  All day happy hour on Sundays is where it's at!!The reverse happy hour on the weekends is really fun, but the wait can get a little crazy.  The place basically turns into a wild sexy sushi club at night.  The vibe can be *little* pretentious in my opinion, but I'm not there to party- I'm there to eat their yummy yummy sushi.",4.0 star rating

Good food. Always poor service. I'm sitting here now waiting for the server to notice that I'm finished and would like my check. Instead he's giving his friends free shot after shot.  I was completely ignored the whole time I was here.  Horrible service.,1.0 star rating

"Sunday is happy hour all day!!!  And stick to the happy hour menu.  $1.50 pieces of selected sushi.  I had the 2002 roll, I think that's the right number, crawfish roll with crab on top.  And then topped with that tempura crumb crap.  Why do places do that?  It's like they are trying to hide something.  Just leave it off.  The roll was okay.  I also got yellowtail sashimi.  Some of the worst sashimi I've had.  I had to chew for awhile to eat this stuff.  The cut wasn't right and there was skin on it.  Glad I didn't get all sashimi.  He ordered the spider roll.  This was probably the best roll I tasted on the table.  A spider roll topped with eel and avocado and no tempura crap, so don't change this one.  He also had the chicken tempura roll which he enjoyed quite a bit.  He also got a chicken skewer for a $1 which he enjoyed.I had a few lychee martinis, those were tasty.  Probably enjoyed the food better with these.  Oh and we had some calamari with spicy chili sauce.  If I was to go again: lychee martini's, calamari and spider roll.  That's it. The waiter was very nice and attentive.  And we were seated right away.",3.0 star rating
"My girlfriend and I went last night before we went out drinking. Service was okay but it took forever to get our main entrée. The sashimi and sushi was very poor quality!! The bill was 75 bucks without alcohol, I mean if your paying that price its expected to get quality!! I'll take my business else were.",1.0 star rating
"I'm going to have to jump on the happy hour bandwagon and say that this place has the best bang for the buck for its sushi and location. They may have high-end, tastier sushi during normal hours and on the dinner menu, but for a good time for decent sushi, this is the place to go during HH.We had a small party of 4 and we decided to check this place out after the raving Yelp reviews. They have great seating outside and the day we went the weather was perfect. I can't remember exactly what we ordered, but after a lot of rolls, beer, and sakebombs, the total came out to around $100 after tip and tax. Not too shabby!",4.0 star rating
Been here several times before and the service left much to be desired.This time was totally different thanks to our server Joyce.Great job guys on the improvement in service. Keep it up!!,5.0 star rating
"The worst... ever!I wish Yelp would institute zero stars because tonight's experience wasn't even worth a single star.Stopped in here for a coworker's going away party. Granted we had a few drinks at another establishment (that has received much higher ratings from me) but we are never a belligerent to staff, we are always super friendly and jovial. And how was it hard not to be, when there was only two other tables in this place besides us.It didn't start too awkward, even though the server didn't know what was in the dishes and had to check with the kitchen several times. The food itself was decent, nothing stellar... I've had  better sushi and I've had worse. Things got much worse around 10pm. We asked for a third round of drinks and we were refused by the ""manager"" as explained by the server.  We were the only paying customers in the place. Really? Things got worse from there. When we asked for our check, the server returned with the checks for all five us and stated that his ""manager"" insisted on adding an 18% gratitude for five people.Things went quickly downhill from there, when we heard the server exclaim in an audible tone that the entire table could hear, ""Oh yeah, they'll be out of here soon.""Really?!?! In this economy, on a Tuesday night no less, you would prefer not to make  a couple extra bucks and prefer to piss off future customers. No thank you.Will NEVER return here.",1.0 star rating
"I love coming to this place and do so often. Their reverse happy hour is the best but the service we just received was terrible. I just came with a group of 5. We had Marissa as a server. She was just awful. Not only did she never check on us, she was a bitch when we asked for things. How dare us want waters. When we finally got our rolls, we asked the guy who delivered the food for an order of calamari and he looked at us and told us to wait for our waiter. After sitting there for 45 minutes without her checking on us, we finally asked for the bill and she said ok. 15 minutes later she came back and forgot the bill and asked if we wanted it split. Then the bill came and all of them were wrong. Horrible waitress, horrible service. Disappointed in a place I like so much especially when it wasn't crowded at all.",2.0 star rating
Decent sushi but fun place to go for a late dinner before going out down town. On Sundays they have a discounted menu all day!,3.0 star rating
"We stopped by on a Sunday night for the first time, and the place was packed! So we took it as a good sign.From the get-go, you could tell our waiter was not happy to be there. He pretty much just threw stuff on the table and wasn't friendly at all.The menu was not very creative, but with it being happy hour, I get it. What I don't get  is why would you serve fish that's is a few days old, and just not fresh at all! Very off putting, and a little scary, to be honest.We called the manager, and he said: ""Oh-oh. Sushi problem."" It clearly wasn't his first one. Then we asked him for our check, complained to him about the waiter and the food, and he didn't even offer to comp our food or anything.It might sound like it, but really, I'm not that picky. If you can, stay away from this place.",1.0 star rating
This place was nothing more than AMAZING!!!! Having a big dinner group meet up was awesome. The best part is that they did not add on a gratuity! Excellent for people in the service industry who tip over 20%!!!!  We also had a person in our group with a soy allergy!! Why go to a sushi restaurant when your allergic to soy you ask?? Because the staff is very knowledgable and accommodating when it comes to people's food restrictions. I will definitely be back for that cucumber-chilantro cocktail!!!,5.0 star rating

"I was at Jo's for brunch with a group of 8. We started ordering at 11:50, and by the time cashier finished ringing everybody up it was after 12. I was the last to order, and because it was after 12, I was not allowed to order breakfast food (they only serve until 12). Everyone in my group had breakfast food, however I was denied service. Can you believe this!",1.0 star rating
"What better way to start the day than a cup of Jo's. Cute little spot with outdoor seating. Extremely friendly and knowledgable staff. Great place for a date, read a book, catch up on work. Just like any other place in downtown Austin, it's street parking only. Kid friendly. Haven't tried the food yet, but there seemed to be a good selection.",4.0 star rating
"This is favorite food and beer spot to visit before a concert at ACL-Live Moody Theatre.  Food is delicious and served promptly, service friendly, very cold draft brew.  They also offer 10% discount off food if you show your ACL-Live ticket for a performance happening that night.  But I keep returning because I am a fan of their food and getting my Live Oak brewery HefeWeizen fix.",5.0 star rating
"I actually like this location better than the South Congress outpost. Indoor seating will get me every time. They also have a more extensive menu. I have enjoyed the Cobb salad and their sandwiches are tasty. The burgers also look delicious. And they have fountain Diet Coke! Which can be hard to find at coffee shops, even coffee shops that are basically restaurants, like this one. A girl's gotta have her fix.I've often joked that Jo's on South Congress wouldn't be the same without the generally indifferent service. That is another difference between the two. Everyone is really friendly. And one of the servers is a fellow Blackhawks fan, so he put the game on for us. Biased Chicago ex-pat points for that.Jo's is also a nice middle ground between the spendy eateries that line second street and say, the nearby Which Wich. The also offer a discount if you have a ticket to a show at ACL Live, which makes this a no-brainer for pre- or post-show grub.",4.0 star rating

"I love their coffee. Don't get me wrong...the coffee at Jo's is always great.But...the food is okay. It's not bad but it's not good. I came for breakfast and ordered an omelet. My omelet turned out to be 90% egg and 10% toppings. Okay well maybe it was just my omelet...NOPE. Looked over at the beau's and his was 90% egg too. After you eat all the topping areas of the omelet, you are just left with this massive egg thing and it feels like such a waste.Get there earlier in the mornings on weekends because the line gets long very quickly.They have tons of indoor and outdoor seating. It's quite dim indoors...weird lighting. I think I'l be sticking with their coffee products in the future since the food was such a bust.",3.0 star rating
"I'm biased. I have nostalgic, too-good-to-be-true memories of the South Congress location. It's the coffee shop I grew up with, the one I went to with my family. It's perfect and don't you say anything otherwise!This location? It's... different. More restaurant than coffee shop, more urban and less laid-back. Honestly, the food is very middle of the road, so I stick to the coffee. Belgian Bomber remains my go-to drink. It won't give me cavities like the Iced Turbo, but I still get in indulge my sweet tooth.The whole outdoor space is perfect. The wood bar adds a touch of color and warmth, enclosing the primary seating area but not cutting it off from the street. The best use of the wide sidewalk of the entire 2nd Street District. Inside is dark and cavernous. It just never feels properly lit, and the atmosphere is always hazy rather than cozy. I always choose to sit outside.",4.0 star rating
"I really want to rate this place higher but unfortunately, I can't. I came to this location for the burgers and the beer, no biggie. But, would it kill some of the staff to have a better attitude? I went in on a Saturday around 6pm and the server had the crabbiest attitude ever! She didn't even look at me the entire time she rang me up nor during the transaction. I think I'll stick to the South Congress location instead. They don't have burgers or beers there but they ARE a lot more friendlier there.",2.0 star rating
"Holy heart attack, Batman. I thought I'd be smart and have a lighter breakfast on my last day at SX in lieu of the usual chorizo or brisket and egg breakfast taco. Alas, my defenses were useless against a sourdough bacon tomato egg and cheese sandwich. Blast it!To say I was well fed for the day is an understatement, and I only plowed through 3/4 of the sandwich. Not for the faint of heart. Great coffee and pastries, as well.",4.0 star rating
"I had ""the sloppy"", it was really good. The egg was served over easy and the sloppy Joe meat was sweet and not too greasy. Definitely need a fork to finish it off.

"I'm a big fan of Jo's. Big fan. First of all, this coffee shop has plenty of space.  In addition to a long bar, there are tons of tables and booths inside.  Outside has a lovely patio area with plenty of shade and even more tables.  Jo's really wants you to hang out for a little bit so you don't miss out on their delicious food.I came to Jo's to get some work done, have an iced coffee and enjoy some breakfast tacos.  In the mornings, Jo's does grab and go tacos until they run out.  Once the morning calms down a little, the kitchen will make you breakfast tacos if its slow and you ask really nicely. I had a chorizo and egg taco as well as a potato and egg taco.  They are fairly sizable and come served with a small side of flavorful, just spicy enough salsa.  The tacos are everything you want your Texas breakfast tacos to be.  The tortillas are slightly grilled, the fillings are flavorful and the eggs are perfectly scrambled.  As delicious as they are, I couldn't even finish two because they were so filling.  I really liked the staff here.  I found them accommodating, complimentary and responsive. I was here around 9:30am on a Friday, sat at the bar and there wasn't much of a crowd inside so that may have helped.  I couldn't get my computer to connect to their wifi and the employees didn't know why so that cut my trip to Jo's a little short.  Other than a small technical problem, I had a great experience here. Oh, and the coffee is good too!",4.0 star rating
"I visited this place about 3 years ago and I am glad that I returned on my most recent trip to Austin.  The weather was perfect for eating outside and we grabbed the only empty seat on the patio.  The veggie burger mushroom melt was awesome.  The fries that came with it were kind of forgettable.  Eating out on the patio and the people watching really gives you a feel for the weird things that go on in the streets of Austin.  This animal lover did get a tad freaked out by the pigeons.  They are out of control.  As a couple exited their table a pigeon came and landed on the table and started eating.  Then came some more and some more and some more.  Think of Hitchcook's The Birds.  It was really gross as they would fly right by you as you were eatting.  One poor slob sitting outside had the luck of getting shit on during his lunch.  Yuck.  The food is terrific.  The location could not be better.  The service is fine.  Pigeons, suck.  I would recommed this place for a quick bite!",4.0 star rating
